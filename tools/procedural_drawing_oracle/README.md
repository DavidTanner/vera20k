# Procedural gameplay drawing evidence

The current chain is **selected local stock MTNK Attack lines against a ground Unit**.
Factory rally and ordinary ground Unit Move drawing are integrated. The whole-scope native/Rust censuses are in
the checkpoint. No unresolved census
entry is completed by documenting it.

## Selected ground Unit Attack

Foot4DC060 uses the Techno6F3D60 turret pivot and70BCB0's live TarCom aim.
The latter leads moving Units using their actual locomotor motion, current
speed, body facing and the firer's current weapon. Attack takes priority over
NavCom and the queued Move route. The source does not use weapon FLH.

`sim::combat::fire_coord` now owns the pivot alongside GetFLH's existing base
and transform. `sim::combat::aim_coord` owns the one live aim query shared by
selected lines and FireAt. FireAt's explicit argument still controls launch
distance/speed independently of its call-local TarCom aim. A null TarCom yields
zero aim; an unresolved nonnull ID exposes a lifecycle defect. No presentation
query mutates simulation, Facing, shared Dummy, timers or RNG. The existing
movement getter is also available to the opt-in capture observer; no new state
or competing rules/speed owner was added.

Native execution is retained in [`action_lines.md`](action_lines.md) and its
payloads:31 prepared Attack rasters,8 retained aim cases,2 full FireAt cases,
real constructor/Unlimbo/action/event/target/Stop/expiry calls and retail readers.
All289 previous rows remain unchanged. `Speed=40` reads102, then the Range5
ballistic postpass uses the previously loaded Gravity6 and stores95. The Rust
fixture runs distinct base/mode/map Process passes; a flattened or one-pass
fixture would supply different state. The actual retail RuleSet comparison
checks the physical MTNK/GTNK/105mm/AP inputs independently.

Focused optimized validation passes the shared aim, FireAt, full expiry RNG
and timer checks, the physical retail reader checks and all27 rendering tests.
The action GPU comparison now covers157 inputs in two sRGB formats at four
zooms (1256 draws), preserving depth. These include31 Attack rows; the existing
five1px clipped Move residuals retain their prior bounded CPU-presentation claim.
Initial failures were fixture setup and one test-only getter export; failure
logs remain with the checks, not silently replaced by the passing run.

Clean release `procedural-unit-attack-production-v1` from`ee20ca9fe` has
executable SHA`4b4a83ceed0f074bab7dd0461c2bfef33f6e26a55c5842e8f43601eaad06e18c`.
Five ordinary renderer XMP03T4 captures exercise actual Select/Attack clicks,
stationary and moving targets, matched enemy-band deselection and observer-off.
Native192×160 crops contain every188 stationary/101 moving line store, with
the moving aim at[8233,23679,416] ahead of target[8451,23680,416]. These stores
match the captured RGB565 output. Both controls draw no line. Paired frames
change only the line and144 source health/selection pixels; selection rasters
are a separate required chain, not certified by this comparison. The opt-in
observer leaves all480000 pixels and1299 observation boundaries unchanged.
This establishes prepared native drawing from captured inputs, not native whole
Scenario/full-frame emulation. The final candidate has identical `src`, Cargo
manifests and build script to the captured release; later changes retain the
evidence and its comparison tooling. Full retail library validation passes
9675 tests (239 ignored), Clippy passes with retained warnings, and all606 Python
tests pass (5 optional skips). The field ratchet remains2505/2505. Exact logs,
source-tree identities and archive rechecks are in the
[validation receipt](validation/unit-attack-checks/receipt.json). The single
fresh read-only [critic](validation/unit-attack-review.md) found no actionable
defect in this chain. No runtime changes followed review; the whole drawing
goal remains open.

The [workload report](validation/action-line-attack-workload-first.json) uses
the actual production builder and pooled GPU upload. At20k selected overlapping
Attack sources and one moving target:34 spans/4216 bytes, mean CPU construction
11.909ms, CPU staging0.0357ms, submission-through-completion1.540ms. Two warmups
and20 measured samples on M4/Metal; GPU timestamp intervals are unavailable.
One selected source costs0.00530ms to build. Expired timers skip construction;
an unselected20k actor scan costs0.153ms. These are component measurements with
repeated overlapping positions, not a dispersed20k game or FPS claim.

Production archives identify the native image and the exact case set they
consume. The original whole-payload hash remains historical provenance at
record time. The Move archive's case set was checked byte-for-byte against
its original commit before migrating that identity, so appending Attack rows
does not invalidate unchanged Move evidence. All compressed Move captures
remain untouched.

## Selected ground Unit Move

[`action_lines.md`](action_lines.md) records the native route, initialized state,
retail palette, input/load timer boundaries, destination setter and draw ordering.
`action_lines.json` preserves 277 native prepared-input controls plus 12 production
inputs. Its metadata pins the image, physical data and reused fixture owners.
The optional 160×160 production crop reuses the Rally surface fixture; the Rally
and shroud payload files remain byte-identical after independent native replay.

The production owner is `app::presentation::target_lines`, using the existing
coordinate/terrain owners, `CdTimer`, `PaletteLight` and shared `surface_line`.
The sole rectangle intersection is now `util::rect::clip_rect`; radar viewport
edges call the shared solid raster. The ordinary Move event reaches the existing
Unit destination setter with native clear-queue1. The input dispatcher owns the
restart, including consumed empty dispatch and empty band release; successful
load reanchors the retained process timer. No new simulation state or RNG stream
was introduced. Native stores do not read/write A or Z or detach objects.

`action_line_tests` compares 120 production-builder inputs, 6 opaque overlap
orders, 77 solid leaves, 45 intersections, timer controls and the complete palette
row. GPU comparisons use the actual batch renderer in two sRGB formats at four
zooms, with poisoned depth and an unchanged-depth assertion: 1008 draws. Five
existing clipping controls retain a documented 1px rounding residual; their 40
GPU draws establish exact presentation of the bounded CPU raster. Other draws
compare directly with original native pixels. The optimized focused run passed
88 tests on the integrated main candidate, including downstream radar/map, input, destination and capture-schema
checks. Full-candidate validation is recorded in the checkpoint.

The [portable production archive](unit-move-production-validation/receipt.json)
contains 12 normal release XMP03T4 scenes and their12 final release replays on Apple M4/Metal. Real local mouse
gestures exercise selection, Move, last-active/expired frames, reselection and
empty bands. Ordinary Stop and arrival exercise NavCom cleanup. Every native
opaque store matches the final frame. The matched-time Move, Stop and reselection
pairs compare all 480000 pixels, changing only 165, 165 and 151 native stores.
After arrival, reselection leaves all 358976 tactical pixels identical; its click
resets the separate sidebar tooltip. These are prepared native inputs bound to
captured state, not native whole-Scenario or whole-frame emulation.
The final executable (`776a416b…`, clean source `d5b667327`) reproduces all
5760000 captured frame pixels and385 observed boundaries. The observation
owner independently checks sealed input bytes, diagnostic clock and atlas;
portable rechecks validate the retained bytes and scoped pixel/state results.

```sh
python -m tools.procedural_drawing_oracle.action_lines --check
python -m tools.procedural_drawing_oracle.rally_production check \
  --archive tools/procedural_drawing_oracle/unit-move-production-validation
```

The [rally consumer check](validation/unit-move-rally-consumer.json) compares the
new release with the retained rally v4: all 480000 frame pixels and 1501 state
boundaries are identical. Original capture directories and labeled binaries remain
with the build/capture owners; no extra executable was copied into this packet.
The final v2 release repeats that exact result; its shared-owner comparison and
the build/native/Rust/Python output are preserved in
[`validation/unit-move-checks`](validation/unit-move-checks/receipt.json).

Dense selections compose native opaque stores into a temporary logical pixel
grid in forward Techno order, then emit disjoint row spans. Small selections keep
the same direct raster. The existing workload test retains
[before](validation/action-line-workload-before.json) and
[after](validation/action-line-workload-after.json) samples: two warmups, twenty
measurements, optimized build, 632×568 tactical pixels in an 800×600 target.
At 20000 selected overlapping Move lines, spans fall from 979995 to 63 and upload
bytes from 121519380 to 7812. Mean CPU construction falls from 14.422 to 8.266ms;
CPU staging from 10.939 to 0.025ms; submission-through-completion wall time from
27.244 to 1.538ms. One-line construction remains about 0.005ms. The synthetic
sources overlap and repeat; this is not a dispersed 20000-unit game or FPS claim.
The [final integrated run](validation/action-line-workload-final.json) retains
the same63 spans/7812 bytes: CPU construction8.541ms, staging0.022ms and
completion1.533ms. Full retail lib9671 passed/239 ignored, Clippy passed,
Python594 passed/5 optional skips, and the field ratchet remained2505/2505.
The [single fresh critic](validation/unit-move-review.md) found no blocking
implementation defect. Its reproduction-command finding and the stale command
owner description are corrected; the exact module command passes without PYTHONPATH.

The implementation cites [WGSL pixel-center semantics](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/#builtin-values-position)
for scaling native logical pixels. The version-matched
[wgpu queue contract](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/c76dea031c688ecef0050dbf60506fff128fb23f/wgpu/src/api/queue.rs)
distinguishes CPU staging from submission and subsequent GPU transfer.
Timing follows the installed wgpu27.0.1
`PollType::Wait(Some(submission))` contract: completion includes uploads, GPU work,
query copying and map callbacks. Metal timestamp intervals were unavailable and
remain null; no GPU-only speedup is claimed. Attack anchors, other Foot paths,
planning, range/selection rasters and the remaining whole-scope families stay open.

## Original executable

All original execution uses active-retail `gamemd.exe`, SHA-256
`1cdd1180e49024fbda8ad568caac2e86e856063ff67ab38f62b7d2c7bb84298c`.
Use the shared [native runner](../native_oracle.md), Unicorn2.1.4 and the explicit
FPCW0E7F/RGB565 fixture. Original bytes and prepared boundaries are recorded in
`rally.meta.json`; the metadata pins the actual generator/helper hashes.

```sh
python -m tools.procedural_drawing_oracle.rally --check
# Only after inspecting an intentional generator change:
python -m tools.procedural_drawing_oracle.rally --write
```

`rally.json` retains 65 executions of the full Tactical6DA9D0 producer (each
with both passes), four overlapping-factory selection-order controls, four retained clipping-rounding controls, two production-crop cases, and360
executions of DSurface4C0750. The producer executes
original Building447AC0/HasRallyPoint455DA0, Map ground/cell lookup, projection,
Line_In_Bounds7BC2B0, and the patterned pixel body. It retains packedRGB565
pixels after each pass, calls before/after clipping, and original foundation
getter/source-coordinate results. ABuffer remains unchanged. DirectDraw storage
access is replaced with original BSurface memory helpers; no executable
instruction is modified. Selection, object/type/House/map/ABuffer state are
prepared inputs. This corpus does not execute a complete native Scenario,
mouse selection, shroud generation, or other drawing families.

Coverage includes live/selected/local/eligible/target gates; InfantryType,
UnitType, repair and cloning arms; foundations through5x3; source height;
all16 nonzero terrain slopes; bridge target flag; elevated object targets;
sequential clipping of the three rows; horizontal/vertical/diagonal walks,
strict tie decisions, reverse direction, negative phases, signed frame wrap,
and mixed zero/nonzero ABuffer samples. The original pattern bytes are saved.
The overlapping controls execute both factory selection orders, confirming
that reverse CurrentObjects order changes the final packed pixels. Both the
single- and multi-producer payloads passed independent native regeneration.

The three `*.instructions.json` packets were generated by `tools.native_inspect`
from the pinned original bytes. They retain the full6DA9D0 producer,
4C0750 leaf and Tactical6D4625..6D479F call sequence (all bytes decoded).
They prove those static instructions, not whole-executable reachability.

## Ownership and integration

- `app/presentation/target_lines.rs` owns rally projection, row sequence, binary
  frame phase and the two ABuffer-partitioned instance streams. It consumes
  the existing selection-order owner, GameEntity ArchiveTarget, ObjectType
  HasRallyPoint, coordinate/terrain query owners and HouseColorRamps.
- `render/surface_line.rs` owns the shared7BC2B0 clipping body, moved unchanged
  from LineTrail, and4C0750 patterned raster walk. LineTrail calls this same
  clip owner. No separate clipping algorithm was added for rally.
- Native6DA9D0 reads the selection vector backwards. Object IsAlive(+90)
  differs from positive health. GetCoords uses the foundation center; target
  own height is replaced by ground plus the native cell's structural bridge
  flag0x100. It performs no RNG draw, timer write, target retention or detach.
- Rendering forks the small NativeCellQuery fallback identity. Simulation
  coordinate callers explicitly retain their original canonical identity.
  Reading an off-map rally target cannot stamp the simulation's Dummy cell.
- House+56F9 is the scheme conversion's palette entry16 (scheme+330), through
  House InitColor50B840 and its campaign equivalent. It is not the separate
  normalized laser color+56FC. Native execution found the N53 middle-row
  LightConvert step is required before packing; the shared PaletteLight owner
  now resolves House RGB and the existing surface profile handles display
  expansion. Raw house ramps remain palette inputs.
- Rally first pass precedes object loop6D8DB0, Spotlight5FFFA0 and
  LineTrail556D40. The second follows BandBox6DA180, as the saved original
  Tactical caller shows. Native ABuffer selects stores without multiplying
  rally color. Shared per-blitter A shading replaces the fullscreen multiply;
  native-pixel GPU composition comparisons cover palette sprites, holes,
  rejected depth and neutral UI/rally stores.
- Both rally streams use the existing UI-camera passthrough pipeline: no
  hardware depth read/write, sprite padding or lighting. Horizontal adjacent
  stores coalesce into spans. Native1x pixels are preserved; VERA zoom uses
  nearest resampling of that logical pixel grid, with pixel-center sampling.
  Non-1x zoom is a VERA presentation policy, not a gamemd zoom claim.

The sRGB pipeline consumes encoded tints and writes an sRGB attachment. The
existing batch shader's decode and attachment encode preserve those bytes;
full GPU readbacks check both BGRA/RGBA targets. The relevant graphics contract
is the [WebGPU texture-format sRGB conversion](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#texture-format-caps).
No new dependency or GPU pipeline is introduced.

## Native comparisons and production validation

The former solid-line implementation first failed
`target_lines::tests::rally_pattern_matches_original_producer_pixels`.
The focused Rust comparisons cover the saved producer/leaf cases, selection
order, simulation-Dummy isolation, 25 defined input clicks, all28 real/Dummy
passability rows, 24 Stop rows and the connected input-to-Archive-to-Stop path.
The shared Dummy terrain-speed lookup now uses the existing terrain/CellRect
owners. Its production retail constructor is checked too.

`production_rally_gpu_matches_native_pixels_and_preserves_depth` passed all65
producer cases with BGRA/RGBA sRGB targets, complementary A passes and unchanged
seeded depth. Expanded GPU checks passed zoom0.75/1/1.5/2, nonzero camera and
poisoned unused hardware depth. Six ordinary native shroud scenes and shared
A/palette composition passed actual readback comparisons. These checks establish
their supplied inputs, not whole native Scenario or object-rendering equivalence.

Four normal release-app captures passed the existing map-observation validator,
including retained inputs, 1500 exact steps, neutral static cursor, idle camera,
actual GPU pixels and executable SHA256. The stock
[rally profile](../map_observation.rally-drawing.example.json) produces GAPILE1477
at31,85 through construction, sets Cell35,89 as its rally and selects it. The
paired profile adds Stop at step1490. Both run with shroud disabled and enabled.
Optional sealed sidebar cursor placement keeps selection from creating an
animated cursor; all existing readiness requirements remain. Python95 focused
checks and the full580-test tool suite passed (five optional checks skipped).

The original Tactical6DA9D0 executed again with the captured Location, target
terrain, frame, camera and native Gold House RGB. The separate
`production_crop_cases` contains106 native stores and the targetless control.
`retail_gapile_house_color_and_production_crop_match_original_rally_and_no_target`
connects these inputs to the production layered retail rules, ART, House color
and full rally builder without a synthetic type or tint override.

[The retained comparison receipt](production-validation/receipt.json) and40
compressed original capture files are portable. Recheck them with:

```sh
python -m tools.procedural_drawing_oracle.rally_production check \
  --archive tools/procedural_drawing_oracle/production-validation
```

For each pair, all480,000 frame pixels were compared. Exactly76 changed, all
inside the native mask and equal to native RGB565 stores; the declared
unobstructed floor covers62 exact stores. All1501 actor/terrain observations are
identical except the factory ArchiveTarget becomes null after Stop. Thirty
native stores covered by the barracks remain identical to the stopped frame:
this does not certify native building occlusion. The shrouded pair also does not
certify native revelation history. The archive recheck validates retained bytes
and receipts; original executable identity was checked when recording, not
reclaimed from a new machine's filesystem.

The first four captures use
[build v2](validation/production-build-v2.manifest.json). After the single critic's
selection-owner fix, [final build v4](validation/production-build-v4.manifest.json)
(SHA256 `c3aaa9ba6e930ca359cbddc1f2b7a7569e148f6b28365d6947fa95a830b72404`)
produced the archive's fifth capture, `rally-clear-v4`. The existing map-observation
comparator matched its complete frame, initial/final state and all1501 observation
boundaries against v2. The portable archive checks this candidate against native
stores again. Its measured last60-frame wall mean was8.503ms, including simulation,
observation and pacing. Earlier v3 output also matched v2; that historical result
and its build manifest remain in the validation logs, with original runs preserved
locally. No runtime Rust changed after the v4 build.
[Preserved logs and identities](validation/log-identities.json) record the
focused tests, native regeneration and release builds. The full retail lib run
passed9648 tests and failed one obsolete fullscreen-shroud source-order assertion
(238 ignored). The assertion and selected action-line order were fixed; all44
subsequent rendering tests passed, including GPU checks. Clippy passed twice;
the second run has723 warnings after removing five new warnings in touched code.
All122 final cleanup checks passed, including actual A/shroud GPU checks and
coordinate-query consumers. The single fresh [critic](validation/critic-review.md)
found quadratic selection acquisition outside the original rally timing. The
shared owner now uses membership indexes and deque insertion for input, recovery
and reconciliation. Native insertion/order evidence is retained in
[the instruction packet](validation/selection-order.instructions.json). Hash-set
iteration never determines order; successful-add voices keep candidate order.
After the fix, the full retail suite passed9651 tests (238 ignored), Clippy
passed (723 warnings retained), Python passed580 tests (five optional skips),
and the simulation field ratchet remains2505/2505. Current main's documentation
and CI changes were integrated without altering any of172 owned file bytes.
The accepted finding is fixed and validated; no repeated critic was requested.

The expanded timing includes the actual selection owner and rally builder,
including20,000 mobile objects that emit no rally geometry. Two warmups and20
measured frames, optimized Apple M4/Metal; no concurrent native emulation:

| Selection state | Before CPU mean | After CPU mean |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Complete20k ledger | 16.5765ms | 2.0991ms |
| Recover missing20k armed ledger | 34.5089ms | 4.3806ms |
| Pending20k selection command | 1.0610ms | 1.0769ms |

The resulting order is checked in full. Read the raw
[before](validation/rally-selection-before.json) and
[after](validation/rally-selection-after.json) samples, including the separate
selection subset, upload/encode and submission-completion measurements. This
closes the critic's performance finding; it does not measure whole-match FPS.

## Measured rendering cost

Optimized Apple M4/Metal measurements use two warmups and20 samples. GPU timestamp
intervals on this backend were mostly unavailable or non-increasing; they are
reported as unavailable. Surviving timestamp samples are not a valid mean.
Completed-submission wall time includes submission, fence wait and readback.
These synthetic workloads are not ordinary match FPS or native timing parity.
The earlier rally rows below exclude selection acquisition; use the expanded
before/after measurements above for selection plus rally preparation.

| Workload | CPU build/raster mean | Upload/encode mean | Completed submission wall mean |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Rally,1 factory | 0.0044ms | 0.0255ms | 1.273ms |
| Rally,64 factories | 0.1146ms | 0.1165ms | 1.339ms |
| Rally,1024 factories | 2.3192ms | 1.4477ms | 6.201ms |
| Indexed A blitter,20,000 instances, neutral A | excluded | 0.0418ms | 3.835ms |
| Indexed A blitter,20,000 instances, live A | excluded | 0.0356ms | 3.780ms |

[Rally samples](validation/rally-perf-release.json) retain interval definitions.
The A-blitter measurements are in `validation/release-validation.log.gz`; the
small wall difference is not a claimed speedup. That broader run passed21 tests
and failed an unrelated existing tree benchmark's unavailable-timestamp assertion,
tracked in [issue1037](https://github.com/YuriPlanet/vera20k/issues/1037).

Immutable SHROUD row spans remove repeated transparent-pixel scanning. For a
256x256 map, CPU rebuild means fell from1.061 to0.146ms at1280x720 unrevealed and
from16.780 to2.487ms at5120x2880 (minimum zoom). Frontier means fell from0.562 to
0.153ms and8.759 to1.444ms. All13 focused native/scene/GPU checks passed afterward.
[Before](validation/shroud-perf-release.json) and
[after](validation/shroud-perf-row-spans-release.json) retain each sample and
excluded work. Allocation/resize and unchanged-frame dirty gating are excluded.

The actual1500-step release captures report last60 frame wall means of8.75/8.77ms
(clear rally/Stop) and8.55/8.42ms (shrouded rally/Stop). This existing frame timer
includes simulation, observation and pacing; it is not isolated GPU time or
ordinary play FPS.

The separate ConstructionYard repack/move route, absent EMP input-admission
state and planning hooks remain broader required mechanisms. This ordinary
stock-factory chain does not complete the whole drawing goal.

## Input frame boundary

The27-row Building443860 input corpus includes two high-bit Frame controls.
Native56E6AF/CDQ and56E6B2/56E6D1 IDIV select a signed remainder without a
negative-index guard. The valid-pool read56E6BF can then read the preceding raw
candidate array or untouched stack. In the split fixture, FrameFFFFFFFF reads
raw slot23 after only8 accepted candidates: zeroed stack returns0,0; prior
Cell6,6 bytes return6,6 and enqueue an event. This is not a defined gameplay
golden. Rust comparisons cover the25 nonnegative-frame rows, and the shared
FNPC owner documents its deterministic unsigned-modulo extension after signed
overflow. No ordinary gameplay selection or RNG semantics change.

## Graphics API references and small presentation residuals

The locked API is wgpu27.0.1 (upstream commit
`c76dea031c688ecef0050dbf60506fff128fb23f`), with Metal backend27.0.4
(`af91efa93da2af9366b252ed7b9a089175f4874e`). Checked API docs/source:
[render-pass timestamps](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/c76dea031c688ecef0050dbf60506fff128fb23f/wgpu/src/api/render_pass.rs),
[queue timestamp period](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/c76dea031c688ecef0050dbf60506fff128fb23f/wgpu/src/api/queue.rs),
[Metal counter sampling](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/af91efa93da2af9366b252ed7b9a089175f4874e/wgpu-hal/src/metal/command.rs),
and [WGSL fragment position](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/#builtin-values-position).
The A texture uses R8Unorm/texture_2d<f32>, unfiltered textureLoad and explicit
round(byte*255); the GPU comparisons test actual byte and pixel results.

Native53-bit/chop clipping can shift an edge endpoint one pixel versus the
shared nearest-f64 clipper; `clipping_rounding_controls` preserves that witness.
Fractional VERA camera/zoom can expose one neutral A column/row at the far view
edge; native integer-camera views are unaffected. These small presentation
residuals are retained under the project contract, not claims of exact pixels.

Per-factory prepared input events now retain the selection order alongside mobile
commands. Original ground dispatch4AE95B..4AE990 reads CurrentObjects[ESI], calls
WhatAction+70 then ClickedAction+140, incrementsESI and repeats. This was checked
against original instructions; the existing saved packet is
[`engineer_bridge_selection_dispatch.json`](../spatial_oracle/engineer_bridge_selection_dispatch.json).
The input resolver does not draw RNG or write timers/detach; its result is later
committed by the existing SetRally/ArchiveTarget owner. Planning pre-hook state
is a separate broad-scope requirement. No whole-window input equivalence is claimed.
