"""Original BuildingClass::Mission_Repair (0x0044B780) on a UnitReload= airfield, one call per
row: the arm 0x0044C836..0x0044C96F that services the aircraft on its pads.

Each row runs the ORIGINAL function (thiscall, no arguments, RET) on the scratch objects of
aircraft_guard.py's ScratchAircraft, with the airfield as the owner: a clone of the Building
vtable 0x007E3EBC whose Transmit_Message vt+0x278 (0x0065AAA0) and Queue_Mission vt+0x1E8
(0x005B35E0) are scratch INT3 stubs, and a scratch BuildingTypeClass (+0x520) with UnitReload=
(+0x16AA) set and the bytes that select the arms before it clear: Bunker (+0x16AB),
ConstructionYard (+0x16B9), Hospital (+0x16C1), Armory (+0x16C2) and UnitRepair (+0x16A9). Its
radio vector (+0xE4 items, +0xE8 count) holds the row's slots; RadioClass::Contact_With_Whom
0x0065AD30 runs natively over it. The contacts are Aircraft on a clone of the Aircraft vtable
0x007E22A4 whose Get_Mission vt+0x184 (0x005B3040), Queue_Mission vt+0x1E8 (0x0041BA90),
Assign_Mission vt+0x1F0 (0x0041B9F0), vt+0x334 (0x004DE580) and Enter_Idle_Mode vt+0x484
(0x004176F0) are stubs. Their type getter vt+0x84 (0x006F3270, a jump to vt+0x88 0x0041C200,
which reads +0x6C4) runs natively, so the arm itself compares the row's Health (+0x6C) with the
Strength (+0xA0) of a scratch AircraftTypeClass. ReloadRate is the row's double at +0x1508 of a
scratch RulesClass named by the Rules pointer 0x008871E0; the arm's FMUL by the double 900.0 at
0x007E27F8 and ftol 0x007C5F00 run natively under the game's control word 0x0E7F.

A stub records its call and returns with the native callee's stack cleanup. Transmit_Message
answers the contact's code for that message (a message the row does not answer fails it);
Get_Mission answers the contact's missions in order, the last one repeating. A row's `recount`
makes vt+0x334 of that contact set the count +0xE8, so the arm's re-read of the count after each
slot shows. Every row asserts what ScratchAircraft.execute asserts (native cleanup,
EBX/EBP/ESI/EDI preserved, no write outside the stack, no read of unsupplied scratch bytes) and
that the arm was entered.

The log is in the vocabulary of the ReloadHost of src/sim/docking/airfield_reload.rs, with the
native arguments: `count` for each read of +0xE8 (0x0044C844, 0x0044C920), `contact N` for each
Contact_With_Whom(N) (0x0044C85C), `transmit 0xMM c` for Transmit_Message(message, contact),
`full_strength c` for the type getter's call (0x0044C882), `mission c` for Get_Mission,
`queue_mission c M A`, `enter_idle_mode c A B`, `assign_mission c M` and `vt334 c` on a contact,
and `queue_mission airfield M A` for the airfield's own Queue_Mission.
