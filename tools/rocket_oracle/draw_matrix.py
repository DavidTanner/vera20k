"""Original RocketLocomotionClass::Draw_Matrix (0x00663470) and the draw it feeds.

AircraftClass::Draw_It draws a missile's body through its locomotor's
Draw_Matrix (ILocomotion slot +0x24, called at 0x00414969) with the draw key
(the HVA frame & 0x1F, 0 for the one-frame missile HVAs), then takes the
camera copy 0x00754BE0 times that matrix (MatrixMultiply 0x005AF980,
0x0041499F..0x004149AA). This oracle executes the same three calls.

Flight samples: every flight row of flight.py runs again through the same
harness (constructor, Move_To, one Process a frame through Detonate). After
the constructor and after each Process, Draw_Matrix runs on the live
locomotor and owner; a row keeps the first frame of each distinct (facing
step, CurrentPitch) and its matrix and key. The sampled flights must
reproduce flight.json frame for frame, so sampling cannot have disturbed
them. The sweep rows record the camera product as well.

Sweep samples: an owner snapped to a facing, with CurrentPitch written
directly. A V3 owner at every five-bit step and ten pitches (zero, -0, both
signs, the stored PitchFinal products, vertical, past vertical), and at both
sides of each step's rounding boundary; CMisl and DMisl owners at three
facings and the ten pitches, with incoming keys 0 and 7. The stored
PitchInitial products the key also compares against occur in the flights.

Native and executed: Draw_Matrix with Matrix3x4_SetIdentity 0x005AE860,
RotateZ 0x005AF1A0, Matrix_rotate_y_axis 0x005AF080, the sine and cosine
tables, FacingClass::Current 0x004C93D0 and the Rules type compare; the camera
copy and MatrixMultiply; the startup camera from tools/voxel_oracle/lighting.py.
