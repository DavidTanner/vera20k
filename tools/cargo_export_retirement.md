# Reviewed legacy libtest exports

`cargo_run --retire-export-plan PLAN [--dry-run]` extends the existing saved-build
retirement owner; it does not discover candidates or establish their historical
ownership. Use Python 3.11 or newer, macOS `nm` and working `lsof`. Paths must be
absolute canonical paths without symlink ancestors (including system aliases).

Review each exact file for ownership and consumers before constructing a plan.
Keep active/final/control/debug binaries still required. A replacement label is
not evidence that a historical control binary can be discarded. Preserve all
native inputs, results, source, assets and required debugging files.

Schema 1 accepts exactly these keys. SHA placeholders below mean actual lowercase
64-digit SHA-256 values, not computed Rust/native goldens or invented provenance:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "checkout": "/absolute/canonical/task-checkout",
  "export_root": "/absolute/canonical/external-evidence",
  "files": [{
    "file": "old-validation-libtests",
    "sha256": "EXACT_ORIGINAL_BINARY_SHA256",
    "reason": "Concrete reason this reviewed binary is superseded",
    "consumer_status": "reviewed-no-active-or-required-consumers",
    "provenance": [{
      "path": "/absolute/canonical/existing-original-build-record.json",
      "sha256": "EXACT_EXISTING_RECORD_SHA256"
    }],
    "results": [{
      "path": "/absolute/canonical/retained-validation-results.json",
      "sha256": "EXACT_EXISTING_RESULTS_SHA256"
    }],
    "replacement": {
      "label": "retained-final-tests",
      "file": "0/vera20k-recorded-cargo-name",
      "sha256": "EXACT_RETAINED_BINARY_SHA256",
      "manifest_sha256": "EXACT_RETAINED_MANIFEST_SHA256",
      "purpose": "vera20k-libtest"
    }
  }]
}
```

The plan binds the exact calling checkout and an external root separate from
source/shared builds. Each file is a unique normalized relative path, without
traversal, wildcard syntax or `.app` components. The selection must contain only
owned exported VERA Rust libtest executables. Provenance/results lists must be
nonempty pinned regular files. At least one pre-existing UTF-8 provenance record
must contain both the exact original binary SHA and recorded checkout path;
otherwise ownership is unresolved. Pinned records are reviewed evidence, not
cryptographic authentication of the original compiler or reviewer.

The replacement uses the canonical preserved-manifest/artifact validator. Its
manifest must record this checkout, source SHA, `cargo test -p vera20k --lib
--no-run`, and the selected Cargo host `debug/deps` or `release/deps` artifact.
Replacement manifest/artifact hashes and purpose must match the plan. Both
original and replacement must expose defined Rust `test_main_static` and VERA
test symbols; native `nm` inspection never executes them. The existing Mach-O
owner validates every slice as `MH_EXECUTE` and enumerates OSO/AST debug inputs.
Every referenced debug input must exist as an unchanged regular file; missing
inputs are counted and block deletion, even when they predate the plan.

All entries preflight under the shared build lock before any deletion. Open-file
inspection, unwrapped Cargo/rustc detection and exact input identities are checked
again before each unlink, including retained replacements and evidence records.
Selection overlapping those inputs is rejected. The lock excludes cooperating
writers; stop other consumers first. `lsof` sees only processes visible to the
invoking user. Arbitrary external writers can still race filesystem operations.

Dry runs write no receipt and unlink nothing. Apply durably records original plan,
SHA/identity bindings, provenance/results references and replacement manifests
before unlinking only selected binary files. It fsyncs their containing directory
and durably records progress after each file. Failures stop deletion and report
`blocked` or `partial`. Receipts include projected/reclaimed allocated bytes and
observed export-volume free-space change; APFS clones/snapshots and other volume
activity can make these differ. Executable bytes are not backed up; all other
files and directories remain. The process is not a filesystem transaction.

Validation: `python -m unittest tools.tests.test_cargo_exports
 tools.tests.test_cargo_labels tools.tests.test_cargo_run
 tools.tests.test_cargo_macho`. Existing label retirement and cache retention
remain separate explicit operations through the same shared owner.

The [saved native validation receipt](cargo_export_retirement_validation/receipt.json)
records a real macOS dry-run/apply on one disposable copy of the current retained
libtest. Native symbol/dependency inspection, `lsof` and the shared lock ran without
mocks. Apply removed only that copy (806,465,536 allocated bytes); its retained
binary, manifest, results, plan and all 402 debug-input identities remained
unchanged. Historical evidence executables were not selected. The focused suite ran 70 checks: 69 passed and one existing optional compiler
check was skipped. Shared replacement
inspection is reused within a locked batch; first-seen identities are rechecked
before every unlink, including mutations during later export inspection.

The initial Windows CI failure is retained in the validation receipt. The
POSIX transaction fixtures now follow the existing saved-label retirement test
admission, while unsupported Windows native inspection still has a fail-closed
check. Simulated Darwin symbol tests explicitly provide native-tool discovery;
no host `nm` installation is assumed and no deletion check is weakened.
