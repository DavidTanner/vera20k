# Build cache retention validation

The shared `cargo_run` owner holds `owned-builds/cargo.lock` across retention,
Cargo, label publication and final retention. `_cargo_cache` is its private
implementation, not a separate cleanup command or lock owner. The immutable
manifest validator is shared with labelled executable resolution; protecting a
library-test label does not make it eligible for host executable resolution.

The policy tests in [test_cargo_cache.py](tests/test_cargo_cache.py) exercise
dry-run nonmutation, budgets, real-free-space fallback, protected dependencies,
all-or-nothing preflight, stale mutable latest records, links, whole sessions,
publication/input races and partial unlink failure. Default repository Python
tests require no compiler, retail data or debugging utilities:

```sh
python -m tools.run_tests
```

The full final371-test Python suite passed (3 optional tests skipped).
The focused final suite passed64 tests:42 retention tests and22 existing runner
tests. The opt-in native test passed separately. Saved log identities are in the
receipt. The single fresh critic found discovery-window, nested-layout and
free-space-error defects. Five focused tests first reproduced those failures;
the corrected owner passes them, and two further tests bound cross-target profile
admission. Directory identities are captured before enumeration, including
intermediate directories. Nested research/build-script outputs never qualify as
compiler cache profiles. Unavailable final free-space samples remain explicit in
the blocked/partial receipt.

Windows CI exposed two portability defects in the initial candidate: `DirEntry.stat`
returns zero device/inode/hardlink metadata, and a parser fixture assumed Unix
absolute paths. Inventory now uses real `lstat`; unidentified inode values are
counted individually rather than collapsed. The fixture uses host-absolute paths.
Two added regressions model Windows directory-entry metadata and unknown-inode
accounting. The initial CI failure is retained in the receipt. A second run passed the
retention mechanisms but found a library-test fixture without the Windows `.exe`
suffix; correcting that fixture preserves the resolver's existing host-only
admission. Both failure receipts remain recorded. See the
[Python metadata contract](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/os.html#os.DirEntry.stat).

[The opt-in compiled test](tests/test_cargo_cache_native.py) creates a temporary
Git repository and owned cache, compiles a real debug object and binary, preserves
a schema-1 library-test label, and puts an orphan object beside the required one.
It acquires the actual project's build lock before invoking the compiler. Run:

```sh
VERA20K_CACHE_NATIVE_TEST=1 python -m unittest tools.tests.test_cargo_cache_native
```

On macOS arm64 / Apple clang17, the native test passed: dry-run left all files
unchanged, apply removed the orphan, source/binary/required-object hashes matched,
the preserved binary printed42, and its debugging dependencies were unchanged.
After trimming, `dsymutil` built a dSYM containing `required_answer` and `fixture.c`.
[The saved receipt](cargo_cache_validation.json) retains compiler identity,
hashes, selected/removed bytes and observed volume changes. Temporary fixture
paths identify that run and are deleted by the test; the harness reproduces it.
This validates the host example, not gamemd or whole-game debugging equivalence.

The earlier production receipt is retained as historical evidence: cleanup was
blocked by debug-map warnings about already missing objects. That behavior is now
covered by a failing-before-fix policy regression. The replacement Mach-O reader
extracts OSO/AST references directly; absent objects no longer disappear from the
inventory. Existing inputs are protected, missing inputs are recorded, and the
preflight rejects a missing input that reappears during inspection. Dangling links
are errors, never treated as missing objects.

[Mach-O tests](tests/test_cargo_macho.py) exercise both byte orders, 32/64-bit thin
and universal layouts, archives, AST inputs, every fixture truncation and malformed
bounds. The opt-in compiled fixture compares references with actual dsymutil output,
then deletes its inputs and verifies that all references remain discoverable:

```sh
VERA20K_CACHE_NATIVE_TEST=1 python -m unittest tools.tests.test_cargo_macho tools.tests.test_cargo_cache_native
```

The retention native fixture now also removes one debug object while preserving a
second one: real trimming removes an unrelated orphan, keeps the surviving debug
input and saved binary byte-identical, reports the missing input, and executes the
binary successfully. This demonstrates retention safety, not recovery of deleted
symbols. [Label lifecycle tests](tests/test_cargo_labels.py) cover exact retirement,
all-label preflight, durable manifest evidence before deletion, running executable
rejection and partial failure reporting.

The direct reader follows LLVM's
[MachODebugMapParser](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/17.x/llvm/tools/dsymutil/MachODebugMapParser.cpp)
and [archive naming](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/17.x/llvm/tools/dsymutil/BinaryHolder.cpp),
with wire layouts cited in [the owner](./_cargo_macho.py). Unsupported layouts,
malformed commands, relative paths and unknown formats fail closed. Reusing an
inspection never reuses its dependency existence decisions: current identities and
missing paths are rechecked before deletion. The cache tests cover restored inputs,
changed binaries, cached failures, inspector invalidation and unknown inode fallback.

ELF scanning uses [GNU readelf](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/readelf.html)
to inspect sections and all compilation units without following debug links or
contacting debuginfod. Embedded DWARF may permit trimming; split/external debug
information blocks it. [Separate debug files](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/Separate-Debug-Files.html)
need identity/CRC and external closure support that is not implemented here.
PE/PDB closure also blocks trimming: [MSVC FASTLINK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/debug-generate-debug-info?view=msvc-170)
may depend on original objects/libraries beyond the PDB. Those formats retain
normal Cargo behavior and make no unsupported deletion claim.

Allocated bytes removed and observed free-space delta are distinct. The native
receipt's small deletion did not imply a positive volume delta: receipt writes,
APFS allocation and concurrent unrelated activity also affect free space.
Dry-run projections are estimates; apply checks actual free space as it proceeds,
then records remaining protected-budget and free-space shortfalls.

The [retirement follow-up receipt](cargo_cache_retirement_validation.json) records
402 passing Python tests (four optional skips), native fixture comparisons and the
real production apply: 8,231 compiler files removed, 19.50 GiB allocated and
19.42 GiB observed volume reclamation. All 51 saved labels' manifests and executable
hashes were reverified afterward. Seven binaries retain explicitly reported missing
debug inputs; their surviving dependencies remain protected. A second preview reused
all 799 inspections with no misses, completed in 13.65 seconds and selected nothing.
Protected files leave the soft budgets unmet; no wider reclamation is claimed.
The old local hourly deletion hook was backed up and changed to invoke this shared
owner with a zero-second lock wait, retaining its existing safe main-sync behavior.
