# Projectile native comparisons

These tools execute the pinned retail `gamemd.exe` under Unicorn. See the
[shared native runner](../native_oracle.md) for installation and executable
identity. This page indexes the consolidated FireAt-tail, load-timer and collision
fixtures; other projectile families still need their own inventory.

## Bullet trailer animations

[`projectile_trailer`](projectile_trailer.md) joins the original Bullet AI
header and signed global-frame cadence to the full physical BBBLELRG
constructor, independent lifetime and deferred retirement. It includes native
divide faults, early waits, preflight coordinates, RNG continuation,
Scalable reader inputs and the original Bullet placement/Fire consumers.
Reproduce with
`python -m tools.projectile_oracle.projectile_trailer --check`; the linked
document specifies extracted retail inputs and the bounded coverage.

The shared IFV admission transport now executes native coordinate fixup and
admission-state writes. Its earlier raw copy retained constructor InLimbo and
suppressed cleanup. Re-executed impact/bridge corpora include the resulting
Conceal expiry/display removal; the LineTrail corpus corrects detach timing to
Conceal before drain. The trailer witness executes full original Fire admission.
See the linked document for those input boundaries and the separate Rust
LineTrail timing residual.

## FireAt tail and BulletFire

`fireat_fixture.py` owns the synthetic object/stack initialization, virtual and
world hooks, checked native execution and observations for these five generators:

| Module (`python -m tools.projectile_oracle.<module> --check`) | Cases | Coverage |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `fireat_launch` | 144 | Ordinary arcing/lobber/floater and speed/delta combinations |
| `directed_launch` | 64 | Original Unit heading receivers, turret/hull heading and Dropping origin reset |
| `building_pitch` | 64 | Original building/base-Techno pivot getters at supplied building heights |
| `voxel_launch` | 20 | Voxel/Vertical combinations and native maximum speed |
| `arc_second_probe` | 96 | Second arc-solver result with controlled prior stack bytes |

Each generator owns its case matrix; shared execution starts at `0x006FE8EE`
and must reach `0x006FF01A` or `0x006FF93C` within the checked runner's instruction
and time limits. Successful ordinary-tail returns also require temporary and
persistent velocity bytes to agree. Failures raise exceptions, including under
optimized Python. Importing a generator or asking for `--help` does not load the
retail binary, execute native code or write references.

The default and `--check` reproduce and compare the reference without writing.
`--write` explicitly replaces output and its `.meta.json` provenance sidecar;
review any change before accepting it. The sidecar records the verified binary,
Unicorn versions, exact canonical payload hash, fixture assumptions and substituted
receivers. It certifies the declared corpus only.

Rust consumers:

- `sim::projectile::launch::tests::original_fireat_and_fire_preserve_exact_launch_bits`
  consumes all five corpora (388 rows) and compares launch success and successful
  binary64 velocity bits using verified retail math tables.
- `sim::world::projectile_collision::tests::runtime_fireat_fractional_velocity_survives_live_gravity_and_snapshot`
  consumes `fireat_runtime.json`: a composition of the existing native Rules
  Process, GetSpeed, shared launch and motion fixtures. It checks production
  parsed inputs, the firing frame's first motion visit and snapshot continuation.
  Reproduce with `python -m tools.projectile_oracle.fireat_runtime --check`.

The runtime composition preserves the two different speed values: the supplied
numeric rules produce stored weapon speed 95 (the postpass runs with prior
Gravity=3), then GetSpeed derives launch speed 59 using the live Gravity=6 and
500-lepton distance. The original ignored test assumed speed 100 and delayed the
first AI until the next frame, and applied projectile ART after its authoritative
read stage. Those expectations predated the native speed, live Logic-vector and
retained ART-state migrations. The repaired fixture supplies ART during rules
processing and asserts the resulting Voxel/Vertical flags. The native loop reloads its count at `0x0055B613`
after object AI, and Bullet Unlimbo appends at `0x005F5040`. The composition checks
numeric components; it supplies the connections and admitted collision commits.
The Rust runtime test establishes that integration only for these two fixtures;
it does not certify the whole native scheduler or collisions.

These are ignored retail tests; set `RA2_DIR` to the verified install and run each
with `python -m tools.cargo_run -- test -p vera20k --lib <test-name> -- --ignored`.
Python import/help regression tests run in `python -m tools.run_tests` without
retail files. Native comparison and Rust regression are separate evidence levels.

The fixtures supply source/target/type/weapon/Rules/stack state, zero-fill other
fixture memory and set the recorded x87 control word. Hooks substitute selected
virtual receivers and world insertion, not numeric results. They establish bounded
launch-tail arithmetic, not full FireAt admission, retail reader construction,
world registration, downstream impact or whole-game parity. In particular,
`bridge_render_flight` deliberately keeps its separate reader/constructor-backed
fixture; collapsing it into this synthetic setup would discard upstream coverage.

## Bullet timer save/load

`python -m tools.projectile_oracle.load_timers --check` executes the original
detector constructor, late Fire timer setup, pre-load check, Bullet Save, global
frame-read prefix, Bullet Load, post-load check and five admission probes for each
of 877 rows. Normal and optimized Python reproduce the same existing reference.
The default is a read-only check; import/help do not load native bytes or write.
`--write --output <candidate.json>` explicitly generates a candidate and sidecar.

This fixture shares image identity, execution completion and golden publication
with `tools.native_oracle`. Its native vtables, stream services and case matrix
remain local: adjacent collision and trail fixtures have different state and
coverage. Save executes outside assertions, and stream bounds, HRESULTs and byte
counts remain checked under `python -O`. The shared runner owns all stop boundaries.

The sidecar records current checked execution and its substitutions; it cannot
recover the original reference's historical environment. The committed 877-row
payload remains byte-identical. The Rust consumer is the ordinary library test
`sim::projectile::tests::projectile_load_timers_match_original_fire_save_load_and_check`.
It compares Arm timer state, proximity distances, watermarks and admission outputs;
it does not assert every recorded first-timer, reference or return-status field.

Coverage is bounded: upstream objects/INI inputs and three global stream DWORDs
are supplied; no global Save executes. Bullet Load reuses the isolated allocation,
with pointer registration/fixup services substituted. The global reader stops
after its third read, before the HRESULT branch; admission stops before detonation
or continuation effects. Timer writes are observed, but full save-game loading,
world reconstruction, RNG/detach effects and scheduling parity are not established.

## Collision and impact observations

`collision_fixture.py` owns synthetic ordinary/shared/homing state, supplied
receivers and checked execution. The three producers own case enumeration and
reference publication; none imports another producer. Their default invocation
checks without writing, `--help` and imports require no retail files, and
`--write` is the only way to replace references. Every native region must reach
its declared endpoint; instruction/time exhaustion, faults and early stops fail
before publication, including under `python -O`.

| Module (`python -m tools.projectile_oracle.<module> --check`) | Preserved rows |
| --- | --- |
| `ordinary_collision` | 134 admissions, 21 matrices, 189 reflections, 115 geometry, 180 final handoffs, 7 nearest selections |
| `shared_collision` | 130 original post-commit probes |
| `homing_impact` | 288 admissions, 72 clamp/handoff observations, 12 source modes |

All 1,148 rows reproduce the previous goldens without changing their file bytes.
The checked `.meta.json` sidecars record executable identity, emulator version,
canonical payload hash, boundaries, supplied state and substituted receivers.
Ordinary admission/reflection and homing use live FPCW `0x0E7F` without changing
the image's cached control word; shared geometry and nearest selection set both.
These fixture differences are retained, not claims about universal game precision.

[`tools.native_slope`](../native_slope.py) owns the startup matrix chronology on
one machine: initial FPCW `0x037F`, `7CEAAF`, `7CBF49(0300,0300)`, `7C5EE4`, then
`754910`, `7549A0`, `7549C0`, `7549E0`, `754A20`, `754A50`, `754CB0`.
Each call must return before the next begins. Its 21 matrices at `B45188` are
shared by collision, terrain, bridge-render and bounce fixtures. It executes
selected original startup bodies, not complete Windows startup. Import migrations
retain the bounce cache; no second matrix initializer is kept in a generator.

Rust consumers run normally in `cargo test --lib` (through `tools.cargo_run`):

- `sim::projectile::tests::{homing_impact_admission_matches_executed_retail_vectors, homing_source_fuse_mode_matches_executed_retail_vectors, native_common_final_handoff_near_target_vectors, native_slope_matrix_and_elastic_reflection_vectors}`
- `sim::world::projectile_collision::tests::{ordinary_tail_matches_executed_native_admissions, shared_probe_matches_original_bodies_and_receivers, nearest_selector_matches_original_vtable_getters_and_list_ties, ordinary_geometry_uses_native_double_and_integer_boundaries}`

The 72 homing clamp/handoff rows have no direct Rust consumer; they remain checked
native observations and are not counted as Rust regression coverage. Ordinary
handoffs separately test near-target coordinate behavior. These bounded regions
exclude complete trajectory, damage, lifecycle and scheduling. No broader RNG,
timer or detach equivalence is claimed. Portable early-stop/publication and import
regressions run in `python -m tools.run_tests`; they supply synthetic HLT instructions,
not a second implementation of native collision behavior.

The [collision ownership validation record](collision_ownership.validation.json) records checked replays, immutable golden hashes, Rust consumers and review fixes. The dependent [Anytown packet](../spatial_oracle/anytown_damage/README.md) has a checked source-provenance refresh command; historical production comparisons remain historical.

## Arc solver domain observations

`python -m tools.projectile_oracle.arc_domain --check` executes 288 input cases
through original angle solver `48A9D0` and word solver `48A8D0`: 576 checked native
calls. Each solver returns success in 196 cases and native failure in 92. Both
success bytes and raw scratch outputs remain byte-identical in `arc_domain.json`.
A native rejection is a valid observation; an execution exception now aborts the
entire run instead of becoming an `*_error` golden field. The current corpus has
no such error rows.

The generator uses the shared `call`, executable identity and publisher directly;
there is no eager RMG compatibility import, import-time emulation or automatic
write. Default invocation and `--check` are read-only; `--write` and optional
`--output <candidate.json>` are explicit. Repeat with `python -O -m` to check that
safety gates remain active. The new sidecar records the supplied register/stack
inputs, `0xCD` scratch sentinel, FPCW and bounded coverage.

Negative and zero inputs characterize solver boundaries; they are not claims
about values admitted by retail weapon rules. No upstream FireAt/type/INI loading,
trajectory, timer, RNG or detach equivalence is established. The word results are
retained native observations without a direct Rust consumer. The angle consumer
checks native failure predicates and successful raw binary64 values; it is ignored
by default because it requires the verified retail math tables. Run it explicitly:

```sh
python -m tools.cargo_run -- test -p vera20k --lib original_arc_solver_domain_and_failure_predicates -- --ignored
```

[The validation record](arc_domain.validation.json) records the native replay,
unchanged golden hash and actual retail-backed Rust run. Shared import/help
coverage for all migrated projectile and animation producers lives in
`tools.tests.test_oracle_lifecycle`; each producer runs in a fresh interpreter,
in normal and optimized Python. `tools.tests.test_arc_domain` separately verifies
that a failed first or second solver cannot publish partial/error observations.
