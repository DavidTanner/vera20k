# VERA20k

VERA20k is a rewrite of the original engine, `gamemd.exe`. It uses the original game files,
so you'll need your own copy of Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge.

VERA20k is made by gamers, for gamers, and gamers have the final say in where it goes.

## Project goals

1. Keep the gameplay, visuals and atmosphere of the original Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge.
2. Support bigger battles: up to **30 players** and **20,000 units** on 500×500 maps.
3. Incorporate known RTS features, old and new, and some never seen before.
4. Integrated multiplayer client

## Current status

**Mid development.** Local skirmish is playable on Windows against a basic AI. Retail and
random maps, menus, base building, harvesting, combat and save/load are in place, but there's
still a lot to fix and finish.

Multiplayer, campaigns and the original AI are still missing. Aircraft, mind control, bridges
and several weapons and effects need more work. We haven't demonstrated 30-player,
20,000-unit battles yet.

## Build and run

You need:

- **The game:** Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge.
- **Rust and Git:** current stable [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), installed with rustup, and
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Build tools:** on Windows, the Visual Studio C++ build tools, which the Rust installer offers
  to install; on macOS, `xcode-select --install`; on Debian and Ubuntu,
  `sudo apt install build-essential libasound2-dev pkg-config`.
- **Graphics:** a GPU with Vulkan, DirectX 12 or Metal.

VERA20k has been played on Windows, Linux and macOS.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YuriPlanet/vera20k.git
cd vera20k
cp config.toml.example config.toml
# Edit config.toml and set ra2_dir to your game folder before running:
cargo run --release --bin vera20k
```

Write `ra2_dir` with forward slashes, like `C:/Games/RA2`. Use `--release` to play; debug
builds are too slow. The log is in `logs/ra2.log`.

## How we work

Most of the code is written by AI coding agents. They use Ghidra to study the original
engine, then port its behavior to Rust and check it with [comparison tools](tools/native_oracle.md)
and playtesting. Agents follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Contributing

Help is welcome. You can write code, refactor the engine, test the game, share ideas, or play
it next to the original and tell us what feels wrong. Open a PR and we'll take it from there;
for anything large, ask first in an issue or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kmjRUn5m5F).

Gameplay is in `src/sim/`, rendering in `src/render/`, and menus and input in `src/app/` and
`src/ui/`; you don't need the Python tools in `tools/`. The
[architecture overview](https://yuriplanet.github.io/vera20k/) explains how the engine fits
together. Run the tests with `cargo test -p vera20k --lib`. Tests that need the game's INI
files skip themselves, and still count as passed, until you run
`cargo run --bin extract-ini [game folder]`.
