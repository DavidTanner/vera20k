//! Frontend shell route (F11): one enum owns which shell surface is active
//! on the `MainMenu` screen.
//!
//! Replaces three mutually-entangled booleans
//! (`main_menu_show_single_player_shell`, `main_menu_show_native_skirmish_shell`,
//! `skirmish_shell_return_to_single_player_shell`) that six hand-written
//! teardown blocks each cleared with slightly different subsets. Exclusivity
//! is now structural: the state can no longer represent two shells at once.
//! A terminal menu error is owned separately by the frontend; it stops shell
//! rendering and input without creating an alternate gameplay route.
