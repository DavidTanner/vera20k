//! Turret rotation system — the `UnitClass::Facing_Update @ 0x00736990` port.
//!
//! Units with a barrel `FacingClass` have an independently rotating turret.
//! When attacking, the turret rotates toward the target at the unit's `ROT=`
//! speed. When the target is gone it holds the aim for
//! `GuardAreaTargetingDelay + 5` frames measured from the unit's OWN LAST SHOT
//! (`TechnoClass+0x120`), then returns to the hull — or leads toward the move
//! destination when one is set. The weapon-fire alignment gate lives in
//! `sim/combat` and reads the same `FacingClass` animated value.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of sim/ — depends on sim/components, sim/combat, rules/.
//! - sim/ NEVER depends on render/, ui/, audio/, net/.
