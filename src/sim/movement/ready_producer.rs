//! Readiness inputs for the Mission gate, derived on demand from entity state.
//!
//! The readiness *predicate* lives in [`super::locomotor_ready`] and is
//! exhaustively tested against the native comparison. This module supplies its
//! *inputs* from live entity state, so the Mission readiness gate stops
//! substituting a constant "not moving".
//!
//! ## Why on demand and not once per tick
//! Native's gate is a virtual on the object's own vtable that performs a fresh
//! locomotor call every time it runs. No cached per-frame "is moving" byte
//! exists anywhere on that path, and the gate is consulted from roughly two
//! dozen sites — not just the per-object AI loop but radio receipt, per-cell
//! process, unlimbo, set-destination and the deploy sequence, all of which fire
//! mid-tick in response to events that themselves change locomotor state. The
//! same object's readiness is also evaluated on both sides of its own movement
//! step within one tick, and the two answers can differ.
//!
//! A once-per-tick cache would therefore answer nearly every one of those calls
//! with stale state. The highest-risk shape is a same-tick stop followed by a
//! mid-tick queue-and-commence — the dock, unlink, unload and deploy handoffs —
//! where a stale "moving" defers the mission.
//!
//! Verified by decompiling both readiness overrides (Infantry and Unit), the
//! queue-then-commence caller, and the live locomotor call inside the gate body.
//! The gate reads `Is_Moving_Now`, never the separate `Is_Moving` predicate —
//! those two are genuinely different in every live family except Teleport, whose
//! `Is_Moving_Now` is the inherited thunk that re-dispatches to `Is_Moving`.
//!
//! ## Why this is a separate module
//! `locomotor_ready` is destined for `sim::substrate::locomotion`, whose
//! dependency floor is rules/util only. Producing the inputs requires reading
//! `GameEntity`, so it stays here in `sim::movement`.
//!
//! ## Error direction is the safety property
//! Before this module existed the gate always answered "not moving", so the
//! moving-defer branch never fired. A producer that wrongly answers **moving**
//! makes missions defer and can stall a unit permanently; a producer that
//! wrongly answers **not moving** is no worse than the previous behaviour.
//! Every mapping below is therefore written to fail toward "not moving" when
//! its state is absent, and families without a faithful mapping return `None`
//! rather than a guess.
//!
//! Drive/Ship share their coordinate query with cell-entry and tube consumers
//! and read the owner's live `GetCurrentSpeed`. Walk reads its retained
//! byte/head and the shared Foot speed fraction. Original query comparisons
//! are in locomotor_moving.json; other family adapters still have recorded
//! limits.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of sim/ — depends on sim/ movement and entity state only.
//! - sim/ NEVER depends on render/, ui/, sidebar/, audio/, net/.
