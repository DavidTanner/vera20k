//! `AircraftClass::Mission_Move @ 0x004166E0`, the handler of every aircraft
//! on the Move mission: a Fly aircraft its player or its spawn manager sent,
//! and a missile its launcher just fired. Its state is Mission+0xBC, which
//! Commence zeroes.
//!
//! - State 0 (`0x004166FB`): with no NavCom (`+0x5A4`) the aircraft enters
//!   idle mode (`vt+0x484(0, 1)`); otherwise its destination becomes
//!   `Find_Attack_Cell(NavCom)` (`vt+0x480(.., 1)`, `0x00418E20`) and the
//!   state 1. Both, and a state past 4, return the Rate epilogue
//!   (`0x00416713`): `ftol(Rate x 900)` of the mission current after those
//!   calls, plus one Scenario `RandomRanged(0, 2)` (`0x0041673E`).
//! - State 1 (`0x00416769`): no NavCom enters idle mode; otherwise the
//!   locomotor's Move_To (`+0x44`) heads for the NavCom's coordinate
//!   (`vt+0x4C`, the aircraft asking) and the state is 2.
//! - State 2 (`0x004167CE`): a stopped locomotor (`Is_Moving`, `+0x10`), or a
//!   NavCom whose cell is the aircraft's own (`vt+0x1B8`), is state 3; a
//!   NavCom cell not free for landing (`0x00419B00`, counting the aircraft
//!   itself) restarts at 0; otherwise state 4.
//! - State 3 (`0x0041698E`): idle mode once the locomotor stops.
//! - State 4 (`0x004169CD`): as state 2, staying 4 where state 2 enters it.
//!
//! States 1..4 return one frame. `0x00419B00` counts the aircraft's own Cell
//! NavCom against its cell, so a moving aircraft with a Cell NavCom cycles 0,
//! 1, 2, a new Find_Attack_Cell and Move_To every Rate epilogue, unless that
//! function answers free before looking at objects: for a cell outside the
//! playfield, an AirportBound aircraft (`0x00419B8A`), or a spawned aircraft
//! over a spawner.
//!
//! The Move slot (`vt+0x22C`) is `0x004166C0`, which sends a `Carryall=`
//! type (Type+0xDFC) to `0x00416D50` instead. RESIDUAL: that handler is not
//! ported. No retail aircraft type sets the key
//! (`retail_aircraft_types_are_not_carryalls`), so it is dormant.
//!
//! Evidence: tools/spatial_oracle/aircraft_move.py runs the original
//! 0x004166E0 from states 0..5 with a NULL, Cell and object NavCom, moving or
//! not, and its Find_Attack_Cell and landing predicates on supplied map
//! states; `world::aircraft_move`'s tests replay every row through
//! [`move_visit`] and the world queries it gives the production host.
//!
//! RESIDUAL: state 2's planning-path arm (`0x004167CE..0x00416885`: with
//! `PlanningPathIdx` `+0x520` set, within 256 leptons of the NavCom it steps
//! to the path's next waypoint through `0x004DC8C0`) is not ported; VERA keeps
//! no planning path on an aircraft. Trigger: a waypoint path the player
//! planned for aircraft. Effect: none until such paths exist.
