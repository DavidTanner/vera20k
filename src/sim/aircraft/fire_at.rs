//! `AircraftClass::Fire_At @ 0x00415EE0` (vt+0x3CC), an aircraft's shot.
//! Mission_Attack's strike states call it for each bomb, missile and burst
//! shot ([`super::attack_mission`]).
//!
//! - With a first passenger (`+0x118`) it drops one (`Drop_Payload @
//!   0x00415C60`) and returns NULL (`0x00415EEE..0x00415F05`), before
//!   anything else.
//! - Otherwise `TechnoClass::FireAt @ 0x006FDD50` fires. When it answers a
//!   bullet, Fire_At sets that bullet's course by its type's `ROT=`
//!   (`+0xAC`, `+0x2DC`; [`AircraftBulletCourse`]): ROT 0 flies level along
//!   SecondaryFacing (`+0x3A0`) at the Locomotor's Apparent_Speed, ROT 1 at
//!   the target at weapon 0's `Speed=` (`GetWeapon(0)`, whatever slot
//!   fired), any other ROT keeps FireAt's velocity. In retail rules the
//!   Black Eagle's, Harrier's and Boris MiG's missiles are ROT 100; the
//!   Hornet's bomb (`NormalBomb`) and the Osprey's depth charge
//!   (`DepthCharge`) are ROT 1, where FireAt alone would launch them at
//!   speed 1 and leave the bullet's ramp to accelerate them.
//! - Then, for the current player's aircraft (`0x0050B6F0`), it asks
//!   `MapClass::IsShrouded @ 0x00586360` about its Location (`+0x9C`), the
//!   Location offset by (0x200, 0x200), (-0x200, -0x200) and (0x200,
//!   -0x200), that last one twice (the fourth corner is never asked), and
//!   the target's GetCoords. At the first shrouded one it reveals
//!   `[General] AttackingAircraftSightRange=` around its Location
//!   (`MapClass::RevealArea @ 0x005678E0` by height, final 0 then final 1),
//!   which maps those cells for good.
//! - Last, with or without a bullet, an aircraft with `+0x6CA` is removed
//!   (UnInit, vt+0xF8 = `FootClass::UnInit @ 0x004DE5D0`). Only the kamikaze
//!   tracker's Push sets it (`crate::sim::kamikaze`), on a missile whose
//!   launcher lost it, and no `MissileSpawn=` type in retail rules has a
//!   weapon to fire.
//!
//! The strike states ignore the bullet Fire_At returns.
//!
//! RNG: none of its own (TechnoClass::FireAt's draws are its own). Timers:
//! none. Detach: UnInit's.
//!
//! Evidence: `tools/spatial_oracle/aircraft_fire_at.py` runs the original
//! 0x00415EE0 with the trig, Vector3D and Apparent_Speed math native; its
//! tests replay every row through [`fire_at`], the bullet's velocity bit for
//! bit.
//!
//! RESIDUAL: Apparent_Speed scales the type's speed by the Fly's
//! CurrentSpeed, a double natively whose 0.1 ramp rounds
//! (0.7999999999999999 on its eighth frame) where VERA's SimFixed ramp is
//! exact (`movement::air_movement`). On the ramp's eighth to tenth frames a
//! ROT 0 bullet can leave one lepton a frame faster (24 for 23 at `Speed=`
//! 30). The oracle's speeds are exact fractions; no retail aircraft fires a
//! ROT 0 bullet.
