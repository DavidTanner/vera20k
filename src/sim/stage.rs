//! One native Techno stage clock, shared by Infantry actions, harvesting and
//! building controls. Original identities: constructor6F2B5E..6F2B81;
//! Techno6FABC4..6FAC31; Building4509DE..450A38. Native Building steps before
//! its Techno AI and skips the latter block; other classes step after Mission
//! dispatch. VERA retains late Construction and mission-dispatch Sell calls;
//! their early Building Update scheduling remains a separate required chain.
//!
//! Native evidence: tools/spatial_oracle/anytown_damage/foot_missions.json
//! ground_firing_receipt and stage_clock_receipt (36 original Techno/Building
//! controls, 58 frame visits and admitted/refused original DoAction controls),
//! tools/spatial_oracle/harvest_field.json and building_construction.json.
//! +104 is copied stack residue and does not participate in the timer decision.
