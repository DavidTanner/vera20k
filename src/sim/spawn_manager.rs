//! `SpawnManagerClass` — the sub-unit pool carried by V3 Launcher,
//! Dreadnought, Boomer, Aircraft Carrier and Destroyer.
//!
//! A techno whose type sets `Spawns=` owns a fixed pool of children. Each slot
//! holds one child plus a small state machine; the manager itself has a second,
//! three-state machine that decides when the wing launches and when it comes
//! home. The manager issues only high-level orders (unlimbo, target, mission,
//! limbo) — flight, firing and death belong to the children's own systems.
//!
//! The parent never fires a real bullet at the target: its `Spawner=yes` weapon
//! short-circuits in the fire path and only hands the target to this manager
//! (`SpawnManagerClass::SetTarget`). Without this module those units carry a
//! `Damage=1` rangefinder weapon and nothing else, which is why a V3 Launcher
//! or Dreadnought is combat-inert until the manager exists.
//!
//! ## The original's bodies
//!
//! `SpawnManagerClass::AI @ 0x006B7230`, `PointerExpired @ 0x006B7C60`,
//! `ClearAllTargets @ 0x006B7BB0` and `Kill_All_Spawns @ 0x006B7100` are
//! ported whole over a [`SpawnHost`]: the manager's own fields and the order
//! of every call the original makes on its owner, its children and the
//! kamikaze tracker. Like the original, which re-reads `this` after each
//! call, the bodies fetch the manager from the host on every access, so a
//! PointerExpired broadcast that a call sets off (a child's Limbo or UnInit)
//! acts on the same state.
//!
//! - AI runs from its owner's `TechnoClass::AI` (`0x006FA94C..0x006FA958`,
//!   `if (+0x2D0) vt+0x5C()`), after the mission dispatch, the passive scan,
//!   the bomb, the SlaveManager and CaptureManager, the IsAlive gate
//!   (`0x006FA735`) and the cloak (`vt+0x410`, `0x006FA946`): see
//!   `world::techno_ai`. A Unit's own Fire_At_Target (`0x007365E1`) follows
//!   its `FootClass::AI` (`0x0073647B`), so the target a V3 hands its manager
//!   when it fires waits for the next AI pass.
//! - AI self-gates on an update timer: 20 frames from construction, 10
//!   thereafter. All slot work and the manager status run only then.
//! - `CountAliveSpawns` (`0x006B7D30`) counts every slot whose state is not
//!   `Regenerating`. The parent's fire gate uses it.
//! - The manager makes **two** separate missile tests. The per-slot
//!   `IsMissileSpawn` flag (`SpawnControl+0x14`) compares the pool's type
//!   against `[General] V3RocketType/DMislType/CMislType` (see
//!   `rules::missile_spawn`); the Launching pass and ClearAllTargets read the
//!   **child type's own `MissileSpawn=`** (`+0xD68`). They coincide in stock
//!   YR; both are kept because a mod can separate them.
//!
//! Native comparison: `tools/rocket_oracle/spawn_manager.py` runs the five
//! bodies (with SetTarget `0x006B7B90`) over scripted V3, Dreadnought, Boomer
//! and Carrier pools; `spawn_manager_oracle_tests` replays every step through
//! these bodies and compares the call log and the manager, its nodes, the
//! kamikaze timer, the owner's burst index and the children after each step.
//! The launch coordinate is `tools/projectile_oracle/ifv_fire_coord.json`'s
//! (`launch_coordinate`).
//!
//! ## `Spawned=`
//!
//! `Spawned=` (`TechnoTypeClass+0xD54`, `ObjectType::spawned`) has four
//! verified readers — `search_instructions operand_pattern=0xd54]` finds
//! `AircraftClass::Is_Cell_Free_For_Landing` (two sites),
//! `TechnoClass::GetFireError` (`0x006FC67B`, T36 in `combat::fire_error`),
//! `TechnoClass::Set_ArchiveTarget` and `TechnoClass::IsIdleForAutoTarget`.
//! Only GetFireError's is ported; the other three are not this slice's.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of sim/ — depends on sim/world, sim/combat, sim/movement, rules/.
//! - sim/ NEVER depends on render/, ui/, audio/, net/.
