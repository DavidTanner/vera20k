//! Crew survival: the infantry that leave a building or vehicle as it dies
//! or is sold.
//!
//! Owner of the three crew producers and the pieces they share:
//! - `BuildingClass::SpawnSurvivors @ 0x00442D90`, called by
//!   `BuildingClass::DestructionEffects` (`0x00441F1B`) while the building is
//!   still on the map: absorbed passengers leave first (Phase A), then each
//!   foundation cell gets one survivor roll followed by that cell's
//!   scorch/crater mark (Phase B);
//! - `BuildingClass::Mission_Selling`'s stage 1 (`0x0044A2EE`, driven by
//!   `production::production_sell`): absorbed passengers, then the survivor
//!   count's crew, each on a random foundation cell;
//! - the crew block of `UnitClass::ReceiveDamage` (`0x007381BC..0x0073838A`);
//! - `BuildingClass::How_Many_Survivors @ 0x00451330`, the building crew pick
//!   `0x0044EB10` and `TechnoClass::GetCrew @ 0x00707D20`.
//!
//! Placement is `CellClass::PlaceInfantryInCell @ 0x00481180`
//! ([`bump_crush::place_infantry_in_cell`]); the exit is
//! `InfantryClass::Scatter(&EmptyCoord, 1, 0)` through the shared forced
//! Scatter arm. Every draw is on the Scenario stream. Aircraft never ask for
//! a crew: `Pilot=` has no gameplay reader and no aircraft caller reaches the
//! crew-type slot `vt+0x30C`.
//!
//! Evidence: `tools/spatial_oracle/building_sale.json` `crew` rows (Sell's
//! stage 1, each crewman's Scatter setter and first Walk Process run
//! natively; `Find_Path` answered with the one-step route), replayed by
//! `building_sale_oracle_tests`.
//!
//! Escapes retain one call-scoped DWORD A8E7AC owner through Unlimbo,
//! Scatter and synchronous Walk: fatal crew443141..443288, absorbed
//! passengers442EDE..442FFC, dying unit passengers738030..7381A8. Sale
//! crew instead lowers it44A74E before Scatter44A768 and raises it only
//! for QueueMove44A76E..44A794. First building placement has explicit
//! priority=false; Unlimbo reads the live counter for its second placement.
//! The shared entry owner preserves the independent raw-owner and earlier
//! Building/wall gates. Original comparisons are in
//! `tools/spatial_oracle/infantry_scatter_entry_priority.json` and the joined
//! fatal `building_death_anims_joined.json`; the latter includes original
//! CRT48E480 initialization of the five89E9F0 subcell offsets.
//!
//! RESIDUALS:
//! - A second SpawnSurvivors after Limbo: DestructionEffects arms the death
//!   timer (`+0x528`) at 0 for an `Explodes=` type (TechnoType `+0xD15`) or a
//!   building killed while Selling (`0x00441C43..0x00441C8C`), so the building
//!   stays alive at 0 HP and `BuildingClass::Update` runs SpawnSurvivors again
//!   after its Limbo (`0x004400D4`), then UnInit. VERA UnInits at once and
//!   runs one round. Trigger: every NANRCT death (the only stock `Crewed=yes`
//!   `Explodes=yes` building) and any crewed building killed while sold.
//!   Effect: one survivor round and its per-cell marks instead of two.
//!   Frequency: every Soviet Nuclear Reactor death. Risk: survivor count,
//!   marks and the Scenario stream after them. Needs a breakpoint at
//!   `0x004400D4` (kill a NANRCT) to confirm Update reaches that arm.
//! - A sale's crew Unlimboes at the Z its request carries, 0
//!   (`0x0044A6C6`); VERA's survivor request carries the cell's level.
//!   Infantry51E01B compares that raw input before the shared type clamp
//!   (`0x005247D0`) raises a below-floor coordinate. Trigger: selling a
//!   crewed building on raised ground. Effect: the class placement arm and
//!   its occupation result may differ; final below-floor Z is clamped in
//!   both engines. Not executed (the sale oracle map is flat).
//! - A dying unit's passengers ([`Simulation::release_dying_unit_passengers`]):
//!   - IsABomb (`+0x8F`) kills every passenger (`0x007380AF`). Only
//!     `ObjectClass::DropAsBomb @ 0x005F4160` sets it: the deck pass of
//!     `CellClass::BlowUpBridge` (`0x0047DDC9`), a Foot whose deck vanished
//!     (`0x004D8D53`) and a locomotor below its floor (`0x00514C0C`). The
//!     object then falls and, once landed, takes its Strength as
//!     C4Warhead with IgnoreDefenses (`ObjectClass::AI` `0x005F4021`),
//!     which kills its passengers too. VERA's DropIn
//!     (`drop_in_bridge_member`) sets no byte and lands the object alive.
//!     Trigger: a loaded transport on a collapsing bridge. Effect: the
//!     transport and its passengers live on, and escape if it dies later.
//!     Frequency: rare. Risk: unit counts. Part of the bridge-fall
//!     mechanism.
//!   - A computer passenger of a unit in a Team joins it (`TeamClass::
//!     Add_Member @ 0x006EA500`) instead of Hunting, and KillPassengers
//!     takes each passenger out of its own Team (`0x006EA870`). VERA skips
//!     the Hunt but makes neither call. Production creates no teams, so
//!     both arms are dormant.
//!   - A vehicle passenger (in `SizeLimit=6` amphibious transports) is not
//!     Scattered (`UnitClass::Scatter @ 0x00743A50`), and its Unlimbo
//!     (`0x00737BA0`) still leaves `+0x220` unchanged. Secondary facing now
//!     follows its shared lifecycle writer at `0x00737BD2`. Trigger: a
//!     transport carrying vehicles destroyed ashore.
//!     Effect: the first vehicle stays on the cell with no NavCom, so the
//!     next one's Can_Enter_Cell sees a stationary unit (code 6) and it
//!     dies where native lets it out. Frequency: uncommon. Risk: unit
//!     counts and the Scenario stream. The next path of this mechanism.
//!   - The selection hand-over reads `HouseClass::IsHumanPlayer
//!     @ 0x0050B6F0` as "owned by the local player". That is its skirmish
//!     arm. In a campaign it admits any house with IsHuman (`+0x1EC`) or
//!     PlayerControl (`+0x1ED`). Trigger: a selected unit of a
//!     player-controlled allied campaign house dying. Effect: its escapees
//!     and crewman stay unselected. Frequency: rare.
//!   - VERA's Select sets the flag only. `TechnoClass::Select @ 0x006FBFA0`
//!     also runs ObjectClass::Select's gates (`0x005F4520`), the object's
//!     tag event 0x21 and the selection list add (`0x00637840`). For the
//!     local player's objects it also plays the select response (vtable
//!     `+0x360`, behind `[0x00822CF2]`). Trigger: every selected escapee
//!     and crewman. Effect: no select voice, and no tag event (VERA has no
//!     object tags). Frequency: whenever the player's selected transport or
//!     vehicle dies. Risk: presentation only.
//!   - A foreign open-topped escapee's Assign_Target(NULL) runs
//!     `InfantryClass::Assign_Target`'s head (`0x0051B203..0x0051B24F`).
//!     The head clears the fire latch `+0x68D`, then forces Deployed,
//!     Prone or Ready by its Doing. VERA clears the target only. Trigger:
//!     an open-topped transport dying with a passenger of another house.
//!     Frequency: rare. Risk: that escapee's Doing.
//!
//!   Each escapee spends Scatter's RandomRanged(0,4). Immediate Walk can
//!   place a center request ordinarily; a raised A8E7AC suppresses that draw.
//!   Initialized48E480 offsets and explicit center/corner controls are
//!   retained in the crew-priority evidence; cold offsets are superseded.
//! - A crewman on a cell the path grid marks unwalkable loses its Scatter
//!   destination in the immediate Process (the movement owner refuses a
//!   blocked start cell); only seen with a building placed partly on such
//!   ground.
//! - House IsToDie (`+0x1F6`, set by `0x004FC980`): VERA has no resign
//!   countdown, so it never suppresses the survivor roll. Frequency: only a
//!   resigning house's buildings.
//! - Original whole GAPOWR fatal/517A50/51DFF0 controls establish fresh E1
//!   Doing=-1 and Scatter admission at51D1AA. Different preexisting passenger
//!   Doing states remain bounded by their own Scatter controls.
//! - HijackerType (Unit `+0x338`): VERA has no hijacking, so the always-exit
//!   hijacker arm is unreachable.
//! - The crewman takes the vehicle's tag (`0x006E57C0`/`0x005F5B50`): VERA
//!   has no per-object tags.
//! - Absorbed-passenger bookkeeping: the House `+0x2F4` counter and the
//!   passenger `+0x438`/`+0x439` flags, and a refused passenger's kill credit
//!   to a Techno C4AppliedBy (vt+0xE0) before its UnInit. A UnitAbsorb
//!   passenger (no stock building) leaves without its Scatter in Phase A and
//!   with it in a sale; VERA scatters neither.
//! - The Nominal survivor flag (Infantry `+0x6D9`, set from the crew type's
//!   `+0xC9E`; a sale sets it at `0x0044A747`; read by
//!   `HouseClass::Added_To_Game @ 0x00502C3C`) is not represented.
//! - The off-map cell a passenger past the occupy list places in keeps the
//!   coordinate its lookup stamps (`MapClass::operator[]`); VERA's absorbed
//!   exit reads the off-map cell's bytes without stamping it. After Phase A
//!   such a Bio Reactor (more infantry than foundation cells) starts Phase B
//!   past the list (open native question); VERA skips Phase B's cells.
