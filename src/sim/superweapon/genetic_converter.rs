//! The Genetic Mutator's launch: `SuperClass::Launch @ 0x006CC390` case 9
//! (`0x006CD7E7..0x006CDA62`).
//!
//! A charged Super (`+0x6F`) builds `[General] IonBlast=` 5 leptons over the
//! cell's deck coordinate (`0x006CD7F9..0x006CD8A5`), plays
//! `EVA_GeneticMutatorActivated` (`0x006CD8BD`) and `[AudioVisual]
//! GeneticMutatorActivateSound=` at the deck coordinate (`0x006CD8D3`), and
//! raises a type-13 radar event at the cell (`0x006CD8E0`). Then:
//! - Under `[General] MutateExplosion=` (`Rules+0x17C8`), one Apply_area_damage
//!   at the deck coordinate: 10000 damage, no source, `[SpecialWeapons]
//!   MutateExplosionWarhead=` and the Super's house (`0x006CD8F4..0x006CD90C`).
//! - Otherwise a walk of the 3x3 block around the cell in the offset table's
//!   order ([`native_cells_3x3`]): each cell's bridge list (`+0xE8`) when it
//!   carries the bridge flag (`+0x140 & 0x100`), else its ground list
//!   (`+0xE4`). Each infantryman (WhatAmI 0xF) on it receives its type's
//!   Strength (`+0xA0`) as `MutateWarhead=` damage at distance 0, with no
//!   source, ignoring defenses, from the Super's house (vt+0x16C,
//!   `0x006CD9F3..0x006CDA29`). The walk reads the next object (`+0x30`)
//!   before the call (`0x006CD9E0`).
//!
//! The mutation belongs to the receiver. InfantryClass::ReceiveDamage's
//! InfDeath 9 arm builds `[General] InfantryMutate=` owned by the house
//! (`world::infantry_terminal`), and that anim's end creates the
//! `AnimToInfantry=` infantryman (AnimClass::AI's MakeInfantry block,
//! `anim_class`). On retail rules both warheads have InfDeath 9, the anim is
//! GENDEATH and the infantryman a BRUTE.
//!
//! The local player's tail (`0x006CDA44..0x006CDA5D`, then the shared
//! `0x006CD51E`) clears the selected Super and drops the queued
//! `EVA_GeneticMutatorReady` line; the app does both from the launch event.
//!
//! Evidence: `tools/superweapon_oracle.py` sections `genetic_launch`,
//! `infantry_mutate_death` and `make_infantry` (Unicorn on gamemd.exe: case 9,
//! the InfDeath 9 arm and the MakeInfantry block), replayed in
//! `genetic_converter_tests.rs`.
//!
//! RESIDUALS:
//! - The EVA line is skipped natively while `0x00A8B538` is set
//!   (`HouseClass::MPlayer_Defeated @ 0x004FC205`), on every client after the
//!   local player's multiplayer defeat; VERA always plays it.
//! - Apply_area_damage gets affectsTiberium 0 here (`0x006CD8FE`); the shared
//!   [`apply_area_damage`] passes 1, as its other callers do (`0x00423E7D`,
//!   `0x0053A5BE`, `0x0053B157`, `0x006632BD`). Dormant: retail
//!   `MutateExplosion` has no `Tiberium=` (production reader).
//! - A null `IonBlast=` or warhead reaches AnimClass or the receivers as a
//!   null type natively; VERA builds or damages nothing. Retail sets RING1,
//!   Mutate and MutateExplosion.
//! - Under `MutateExplosion=`, a victim's UnInit runs at the area damage's
//!   tail (`world::damage_consequences`), not at once in its InfDeath 9 arm
//!   (`0x00518B9A`), so a later victim in the same cell still finds it
//!   marked. Only that victim's PlaceInfantryInCell answer can change, when
//!   it stands off spots 2 to 4 (preference 0 or 1) while earlier victims
//!   hold all three: VERA then plays Die2 where gamemd mutates it.
//!   Frequency: rare (four infantrymen in one cell).
//!
//! Ledger:
//! - Scenario draws: the IonBlast anim's constructor, then the receivers':
//!   each victim's PlaceInfantryInCell and InfantryMutate constructor among
//!   them.
//! - Timer writes and detach calls: none of the launch's own; each death's
//!   are its receiver's.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of sim/ — depends on rules/, sim/superweapon/cell_grid, sim/combat,
//!   sim/radar, sim/world.
//! - sim/ NEVER depends on render/, ui/, audio/, net/.
