//! Mutable bridge runtime state layered on top of resolved terrain.
//!
//! Bridges are modeled as terrain, not spawned entities. This module owns the
//! destroyable runtime state used by combat, layered pathing, and bridge-deck
//! fallout handling.
//!
//! Ordinary wooden74..101 and concrete205..232 overlays share scalar
//! `ordinary_damage` / `ordinary_repair` controllers and synchronous world
//! publication. CellClass (`ResolvedTerrainGrid`) is the only owner of per-cell
//! bridge state: the +140 flags, +11E state byte, +44 overlay identity and
//! level. This module keeps only the map-wide bridge records and constants;
//! [`cell_render_state`] decodes the live CellClass fields for readers.

//!
//! ## Tagged natives with no counterpart in this crate
//!
//! Four members of the Ghidra BRIDGE_HIGH / BRIDGE_LOW tag sets have no Rust
//! behaviour to compare against, each for a different and verified reason:
//!
//! - `MapClass::RecalcBridgeShroudFlags` 0x00578100 — **not bridge code.**
//!   Body decompiled 2026-08-19: two whole-map cell iterations that recompute
//!   shroud edge bitmasks through `Shroud_EdgeBitmask_Calculator` into
//!   `cell+0x120` and enqueue tactical redraws. No bridge field, flag or
//!   tileset appears in it, and the `+0x140` bit 0x20 its first pass gates on
//!   is not a bridge bit — `SetBridgeDirection`'s clear mask 0xFFFEE07F
//!   preserves it. The tag is wrong; removing it needs a Ghidra write.
//! - `FUN_0056A080` — bridge code with zero xrefs. Whether that is genuine
//!   dead code or a lost indirect reference is unresolved; either way nothing
//!   reaches it at runtime, so there is nothing to be faithful to.
//! - `MapClass::IncrementBridgeCounter` 0x00578AC0 — single caller
//!   `FUN_004F42F0`, itself untraced, so no trigger is established. No
//!   counterpart here.
//! - `ShipLocomotionClass::Compute_BridgeZOffset` 0x0069EBB0 — no CALL xrefs.
//!   Its Drive-side analogue `DriveLocomotionClass::ComputeBridgeZOffset`
//!   0x004AF4A0 is a one-shot constant initializer and is bound in
//!   `sim::movement::movement_bridge`; this one cannot be bound without a
//!   reference.
