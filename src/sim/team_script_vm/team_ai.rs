//! `TeamClass::AI @ 0x006E9140`: each team's update, and the state it keeps
//! about its members: `Recalc @ 0x006EA3E0`, `Calc_Center @ 0x006EAEE0`,
//! `Regroup @ 0x006EB870`, the under-strength retreat (`0x006EA0D0`) and a
//! member's damage report (`0x006EB380`).
//!
//! Native evidence: the instruction-level spec
//! `vera20k-dev/research/chain5/chain5_team_ai_native.md` and the saved
//! disassembly (`asm/teamai.asm`, `recalc.asm`, `calccenter.asm`,
//! `regroup.asm`, `retreat.asm`, `tookdmg.asm`, `footdmg.asm`). Native
//! execution: `tools/team_recruit_oracle.py`'s `recalc`, `center` and
//! `distance` rows replay in `recruit_oracle_tests`.
//!
//! RESIDUALS:
//! - `Calc_Center`'s branch for a team whose current action is 10 (follow a
//!   friendly unit, `0x006EAF1C..0x006EB1B0`) is not ported; action 10 is
//!   not, so such a team is stopped on it, and its centre is the mean as for
//!   any other action.
//! - `Recalc` destroying an empty team that was leaving the map (`+0x82`)
//!   first springs trigger event 0x17 ("team leaves map") on every tag
//!   (`0x006EA49F..0x006EA4D2`, `0x006E53A0`), whose evaluation draws on the
//!   Scenario RNG for a trigger with event 51 (`0x007264C0` ->
//!   `0x00726400`). VERA has no live tags (`trigger_runtime` residual), so
//!   nothing is sprung. Trigger: a team sent to an off-map cell (action 54
//!   without a passable cell) loses its last member. Effect: map triggers on
//!   event 0x17 never fire from it.
//! - `+0x75` (NeedsRegrouping, written by Regroup and the damage report)
//!   and `+0x76` (written by Recalc under `GuardSlower=`) are not kept: no
//!   TeamClass code reads either. `+0x77` (forced active) is written only by
//!   reinforcements (`0x0065DD64`), not ported, and reads as clear.
//! - The under-strength retreat moves the team to its centre: the search
//!   for the house's nearest safe unarmed building (`0x006EA173..
//!   0x006EA39B`), which weights distance by the House threat map
//!   (`0x0056BCD0`, whose producers `AI_BuildThreatMap @ 0x0050940A` and
//!   `Adjust_Threat @ 0x004FA31B` are not ported) and asks `0x004CBC40` for a
//!   cell beside it, is not ported. Natively that search starts from the
//!   same centre cell and keeps it when no building yields a cell. Trigger: a
//!   formed team falls to a third of its TaskForce (`Reinforce=yes`, more
//!   than two) or loses its first member. Effect: the team regroups where it
//!   stands instead of falling back to a base building.
