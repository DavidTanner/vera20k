//! Who joins a team and who leaves it: `TeamClass::Can_Add @ 0x006EA610`,
//! `Add_Member @ 0x006EA500`, `Remove_Member @ 0x006EA870` and `Recruit @
//! 0x006EAA90`, with the two callers that empty a team: its destructor
//! (`0x006E8DE0`) and the base-defense suspension (`0x006EC250`).
//!
//! The VM owns the member lists; these functions keep each member's own
//! state in step with them.
//!
//! Native evidence: the instruction-level specs in
//! `vera20k-dev/research/chain5/chain5_recruit_native.md`, and the
//! disassembly saved beside it (`asm/canadd.asm`, `addmember.asm`,
//! `removemember.asm`, `recruit.asm`, `team_dtor.asm`). Native execution:
//! `tools/team_recruit_oracle.py`'s `recruit` rows (the group filter and
//! penalty, the wrapping key, ties, the Unit search's own test, the entry
//! gate) replay in `recruit_oracle_tests`.
//!
//! RESIDUALS (none has a retail producer or reader that changes a skirmish):
//! - An object's team group (`+0x214`), which `Add_Member` writes
//!   (`0x006F1870`) and `Recruit` filters and penalises by, is not
//!   represented: every object reads -1, the constructor value, as every
//!   retail TeamType and TaskForce leaves `Group=` at -1.
//! - The TeamType's `Waypoint=` (`+0xD4`), which overrides the recruiting
//!   origin (`0x006EAAD8..0x006EAB20`), is not read; no retail AIMD TeamType
//!   sets one.
//! - The team Tag (`+0x70`) attach and detach (`0x005F5B50`) are not
//!   ported; no retail TeamType names a Tag.
//! - `Remove_Member` sets `+0x6B8` on every object it is called for; only a
//!   `Weeder=` unit's Mission_Guard reads it (`0x00740A60`), and VERA's
//!   Weeder takes its own guard arm.
//! - `Can_Add`'s building-entry flags (`0x004E0080`: `+0x68F`/`+0x690`/
//!   `+0x691`) and lifted-object link (`+0x2B0`) have no VERA writer: the
//!   AI's grinder, reactor and bunker seeks and the Magnetron are not
//!   ported, so both tests pass.
//! - `Recruit` adds a recruited unit's passengers (`0x006EADE8..0x006EAE17`);
//!   a passenger is in limbo, which `Can_Add` refuses while `ScenarioInit`
//!   is 0, so the loop adds nothing in play and is not ported.
//! - The team's Risk (`+0x4C`, the members' `ThreatPosed=` sum) is not kept:
//!   no ported reader.
//! - `Remove_Member`'s callers in unported owners do not remove: the
//!   Magnetron's lift (`0x00710349`), a building's occupant release with
//!   Hunt (`0x0045812B`), and script actions 8 and 60-64 and the team change
//!   and merge (`0x006EF392`, `0x006EF416`, `0x006E9E24..0x006E9F38`,
//!   `0x006E96FD`, `0x006ECFF8`).
//! - The removal loops in `0x006ECB50` (`0x006ECB7C..0x006ECCBC`) and
//!   `0x0070F890` (`0x0070F8C7`) are not ported: neither function has a call
//!   or a pointer anywhere in the executable (`tools.native_inspect calls`
//!   and `find-bytes`).
