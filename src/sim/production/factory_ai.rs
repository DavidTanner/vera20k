//! A computer house's production at its own factory buildings:
//! `BuildingClass::Factory_AI @ 0x004500F0`, run in the building's Update
//! right after UpdateRepairAndPower when its type has a `Factory=`
//! (`0x004401BB..0x004401CD`). The building's factory
//! (`BuildingClass+0x524`) sits in the registry under
//! [`FactoryHolder::Building`] and steps with every other factory in
//! construction order; before each try at placing its object it waits for
//! the building's `ai_placement_timer` (`+0x550`).
//!
//! Each visit, in order:
//! - A finished object (`FactoryClass::IsComplete @ 0x004CA130`) whose wait
//!   is over leaves through `Exit_Object` (`vt+0x100`: a building through
//!   [`ai_base_building::exit_building`], any other object through
//!   [`exit_produced_object`]). Placed: `Record_Last_Built @ 0x004FB6B0` and
//!   `CompletedProduction @ 0x004CA1A0`, which lets the object go, then the
//!   factory is deleted. Try later: the wait restarts for `[General]
//!   PlacementDelay=`. Failed: a naval building turns the house's naval
//!   choices off, then `AbandonProduction @ 0x004C9FF0` refunds and destroys
//!   the object and the factory is deleted.
//! - Then, for a house whose Production latch is set (`+0x1EE`) and a
//!   building neither building up nor selling (`Get_Mission` 0x12/0x13; a
//!   yard whose build-up ends this frame already reads Guard, as the repair
//!   step does, `GameEntity::constructing_or_selling`): a
//!   factory whose wait is over with no rate or stopped is abandoned; with
//!   no factory, a house holding more than 10 credits makes one for its
//!   choice (`Suggest_New_Object @ 0x004FBD80`) and starts it
//!   (`FactoryClass::StartProduction @ 0x004C9C70`, then the build start
//!   `0x004C9EA0`; the call between, `0x004FF540`, is an empty body); a
//!   failed start deletes it unrefunded. A war factory makes no Unit whose
//!   `Naval=` differs from its own (`0x00450343..0x0045036A`).
//!
//! The same factory also goes, abandoned, with its building's
//! `Detach_All(1)` (a kill, a sale's completion or a Limbo, [`detach_all`])
//! and `ChangeOwner` (`0x004486DF..0x00448701`).
//!
//! Evidence: instruction reading of the bodies named here. The retry wait
//! (`ftol(PlacementDelay * 900.0)`, `RuleSet::placement_delay_frames`) is
//! executed by `tools/ai_base_building_oracle.py`.
//!
//! RESIDUALS:
//! - A placed object plays the building type's `CreateUnitSound=`
//!   (`+0xE74`, read at `0x004607C8..0x004607F8`) at the building
//!   (`0x00450198`); among retail types only the Cloning Vats set it, which
//!   have no `Factory=`.
//! - The try-later branch also copies an uninitialised stack word into the
//!   timer's middle field (`+0x554`, `0x004501F1`), which no reader uses.
//! - Mobile products share `Exit_Object443C60` through
//!   [`exit_produced_object`], including radio capacity and Infantry GetDockCell,
//!   Unlimbo and reciprocal tethering. The specialized refinery/weeder/naval/
//!   war-factory arms retain their existing adapters; computer Infantry's
//!   `House500200` order-selection arm and specialized Archive behavior remain
//!   residuals. Trigger: those computer/specialized products. Effect: their
//!   later mission selection can differ despite sharing admission and placement.
