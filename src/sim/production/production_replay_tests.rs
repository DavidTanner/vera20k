//! P5c — the Factory/House authority-flip replay/parity ACCEPTANCE GATE.
//!
//! The ratification of the P5b authority flip (the first hashed-state change).
//! Drives REAL production commands (`QueueProduction` / `SuspendProduction` /
//! `CancelProductionByType`) through `advance_tick` and the shared replay harness
//! (`ReplayLog` / `ReplayRunner`), and asserts:
//!
//!   - (A) DETERMINISM — a recorded production command stream, run live TWICE and
//!     replayed once through `ReplayRunner`, yields a bit-identical per-tick
//!     `state_hash` timeline. This is the lockstep ratification of the flip: the
//!     newly-hashed `Factory`/`Economy` state machine adds no nondeterminism.
//!   - (B) CONSERVATION (C15) — over a refund-free replay, EVERY tick conserves
//!     `Σ_owners(house.economy.credits + economy.spent_credits) == Σ_owners(initial)`.
//!     The per-step charge moves credits out of the one wallet into `spent_credits`
//!     and nowhere else; no credit is created or destroyed by the charge machinery.
//!
//! Pre-flip-baseline observable equivalence (P5c part C) is intentionally DEFERRED:
//! the pre-flip charge path is retired at the flip. The determinism + conservation
//! gates here are the load-bearing ratification of the flip.
//!
//! Cross-sim replay invariant: a command carries owner/type as `InternedId`, and
//! `advance_tick` resolves those IDs against the sim's OWN interner. `scenario()`
//! is fully deterministic (interns rules → types → owners in a fixed order), so any
//! two sims it produces have identical interner state — an `InternedId` minted
//! against one is valid in the other. Both the recording sim and the replay sim are
//! built by `scenario()`, so the recorded `CommandEnvelope`s resolve correctly on
//! playback.
