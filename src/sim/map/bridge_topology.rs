//! Bridge topology read service (Slice 3).
//!
//! Single owner of the gamemd-native bridge bit semantics and signed
//! effective-height math, plus the service-facing handle for the traversal gate.
//! Consumers (combat AoE, line of fire and InRange's elevation bonus)
//! construct a borrowed `CellBridgeView` over the canonical cell store or a
//! Map lookup's answer and read these predicates instead of re-deriving each
//! one at their own call site.
//!
//! It holds the structural/anchor flag predicates, signed effective height,
//! the list layer enum and the AoE object-layer selector.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Depends on map/bridge_facts (flag bits) and map/resolved_terrain.
//! - NEVER depends on render/ — the render draw-offset lives behind a separate
//!   render-facing trait so this module stays render-free (invariant #1).
//! - All math is integer / `i8`-signed. No f32/f64 (the float boundary is INI
//!   parse only, which this module does not touch).

// --- Bridge traversal notes ---------------------------------------------------
//
// The traversal gate is owned by `pathfinding::check_bridge_traversal`.
//
// GATE A4 inventory (verified, `GATE_BRIDGE_TRAVERSAL_RESOLUTION_GHIDRA_REPORT.md`):
//   - In gamemd the ground-unit bridge-traversal validator is dispatched via the
//     Foot/Unit/Infantry vtable slot `+0x1B0` (Aircraft/Building override that
//     slot with non-bridge functions, so the dispatch is ground-unit-only).
//   - Warhead field `+0x144` is the `Wall=` boolean (INI key "Wall", default
//     false). It is the per-warhead half of the AoE bridge-destruction gate
//     (`DestroyableBridges && warhead.wall`) and also allows overlay-wall
//     destruction. NOT to be conflated with `WallAbsoluteDestroyer` (`+0x145`).
//     Recorded here for the topology inventory; the warhead parser/collapse wiring
//     that consumes it is out of this slice's scope.
//   - The `Level + 4` height seed the gate applies is the Level-unit pathfinding
//     seed (1 ElevationIncrement) — DISTINCT from the lepton coordinate-Z deck
//     offset (`BRIDGE_DECK_HEIGHT_LEPTONS`). The two are never mixed (A1 §5).
