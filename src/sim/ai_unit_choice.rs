//! The computer's Unit, Infantry and Aircraft choices: the type each of its
//! war factories, barracks and airfields makes next.
//!
//! Native owner: `HouseClass`. `+0x5650` (Unit), `+0x5654` (Infantry) and
//! `+0x5658` (Aircraft) hold a type's index in its class array, -1 for none
//! (constructor `0x004F5BC6..0x004F5BD2`). The choosers (`AI_Choose_Unit @
//! 0x004FEA60`; `0x004FEEE0` for infantry and `0x004FF210` for aircraft,
//! whose Ghidra labels are swapped) fill a choice that is -1; the house's
//! chooser dispatch calls them (`sim::ai_base_building`). A factory building
//! makes the choice (`Suggest_New_Object @ 0x004FBD80`,
//! `production::factory_ai`), whose exit clears it again
//! (`BuildingClass::Exit_Object`, `0x00443CCA`, `0x00444119`, `0x00444131`),
//! as does its abandon (`FactoryClass::AbandonProduction`,
//! `production::factory_lifecycle`).
//!
//! A chooser asks what the house's teams still need. Every team of the house
//! still taking members (a `Reinforce=` team until full, any other until it
//! reaches strength) adds its TaskForce less its members
//! (`TeamClass::Get_Needed_Types @ 0x006EF4D0`); each of the house's
//! objects of the class free to join (`FootClass::IsRecruitable @
//! 0x004DA230`) covers one need of its type. Among the types still needed
//! that `CanBuild` admits and the house can pay for, it draws once, always:
//! below `[General] FillEarliestTeamProbability=` percent it takes the type
//! of the earliest team, otherwise it draws again among the most needed
//! types. The Unit chooser first keeps the house's harvesters up (see
//! [`choose`]).
//!
//! Evidence: instruction reading of the three bodies and their helpers;
//! `tools/ai_team_oracle.py` executes the choosers with CanBuild, Cost_Of,
//! Available_Money, IsRecruitable and the draws hooked (the
//! `ai_unit_choice_tests` goldens).
//!
//! RESIDUALS:
//! - Native tallies need in stack arrays of 100 entries: a class with more
//!   than 100 types, or more than 100 candidate types, writes past them.
//!   VERA sizes them by the class. Retail classes hold fewer than 100 types.
//! - A team's `+0x79` (full) and `+0x77` (forced) are written only by
//!   recruitment, which is not ported (`sim::team_script_vm`), so a
//!   `Reinforce=` team counts as needing members forever.
