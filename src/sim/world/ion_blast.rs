//! IonBlastClass: the screen ripple a Psychic Dominator strike leaves.
//!
//! Native owner: the vector `0x00AA0118` (items `0x00AA011C`, count
//! `0x00AA0128`) of 0x14-byte blasts: a coordinate (+0..+8), a frame (+0xC)
//! and a flag (+0x10) that skips the forces. Here the list is
//! `Simulation::ion_blasts`; only this module writes it.
//!
//! - The constructor (`0x0053CB10`) takes the coordinate, zeroes the frame and
//!   the flag and appends the blast. `PsyDom::MindControlArea` constructs one
//!   at the target cell's GetCoords and sets its flag
//!   (`0x0053B087..0x0053B0D4`), before the second anim.
//! - `IonBlastClass::UpdateAll @ 0x0053D310`, from LogicClass::PerTickUpdate
//!   after the object loop (`0x0055B64B`, before the crate timers), visits the
//!   blasts last to first (`0x0053CBE0`): one whose frame is 79 or more is
//!   removed and deleted, and a flagged one advances its frame. A blast made in
//!   the frame's superweapon pass is at frame 1 by the draw, draws frames 1 to
//!   79 and goes at its 80th update.
//! - `IonBlastClass::DrawAll @ 0x0053D850` reads the list for the tactical
//!   draw ([`Simulation::ion_blasts`], `render::terrain_ion_blast`).
//!
//! Scenario draws, timer writes and detach calls: none. Not saved (no save
//! code reads the vector) and not hashed: a flagged blast changes no other
//! state.
//!
//! Evidence: `tools/superweapon_oracle.py` section `ion_blast_update` runs the
//! original UpdateAll; `tests::update_all_matches_native` replays it. The
//! constructor and MindControlArea's call are read from the instructions.
//!
//! RESIDUALS:
//! - The unflagged update (`0x0053CC3A..0x0053D2FC`: at frame 0 the splash or
//!   `IonBlast=` anim, `IonBeam=`, `IonCannonDamage=` area damage and its
//!   flash; every frame the ripple rocks the voxel objects within three cells)
//!   is not ported. Only map trigger actions make an unflagged blast
//!   (`TActionClass::Execute`'s call at `0x006DD9AB`, `TActionClass::
//!   IonBlastAtWP @ 0x006E3380`), and VERA ports neither.
//! - Native never clears the vector at a scenario start, so a blast alive when
//!   a game ends draws on in the next one's first frames. VERA's blasts belong
//!   to the match.
