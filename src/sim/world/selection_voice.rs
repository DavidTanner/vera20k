//! The successful normal Techno Select's voice tail, sharing the existing
//! process Main RNG with terrain variants and the other sound producers.
//!
//! Native: TechnoSelect6FBFA0, VoiceSelect708EB0, QueueMegaMission6FFBE0's
//! default VoiceSpecialAttack6FFD42, and shared QueueVoice708D90;
//! executed comparisons: tools/input_oracle/selection_navigation.json.
//! Main886B88 is excluded from lockstep hashes and snapshot bytes. Fresh
//! loading advances it before gameplay; in-scenario restore retains its live
//! continuation through `retain_in_scenario_process_state_from`.
//!
//! VoiceSelect708EB5 checks the existing SlaveOwner+2DC before choosing
//! type+430 instead of the normal+414 list. Both paths use this one owner.
//! RESIDUAL: offline Robot receivers choose type+44C; their power lifecycle
//! and separate voice list remain outside this path. The process audio service
//! borrows this same Main continuation through Simulation's RNG capability.
//! These selection controls alone do not establish its device/queue behavior.
