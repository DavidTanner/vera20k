//! The block `BuildingClass::ReceiveDamage` (`0x00442230`) runs at
//! `0x00442942..0x00442A90`, after the TechnoClass receiver (`0x00442425`,
//! whose ShouldRetaliate has already had its say), the result switch and the
//! IsAlive re-test (`0x00442905`), for a building a hit with a source left
//! alive with a non-zero result:
//!
//! - unless the type is `Insignificant=` (`+0x232`) or 1x1 with
//!   `UndeploysInto=` (vt+0x80, `0x00465D40`), the owner's
//!   `HouseClass::NotifyUnderAttack` (`0x004F93E0`);
//! - `+0x53C` takes the source house's index (`0x00442980`). A CRC fold and a
//!   `!= -1` test (`0x0070304D`, `0x007033C3`) are its only readers, and a
//!   house index never meets that test, so VERA keeps no copy;
//! - nothing more when the raw mission (`+0xAC`) is Selling, the owner is
//!   allied with the source (`0x004F9A90`), weapon 0 cannot aim
//!   ([`building_weapon0_aims`]), or TarCom is in range of the weapon
//!   SelectWeapon picks for it (vt+0x3AC, `0x006F7780`);
//! - an Aircraft source, or any source while the owner is human and
//!   `[CombatDamage] PlayerReturnFire=` (`Rules+0x17EC`) is clear, turns
//!   `+0x388` to a random direction. That happens only if `+0x388` is not
//!   still rotating (`0x004C9480`) and the building is operational (vt+0x350).
//!   One Scenario `Random::Next` (`0x00442A73`) draws it; its low byte is the
//!   direction's high byte (`Set_Desired` `0x004C9220`, at the type's
//!   `ROT=`). For a `Turret=yes` type `+0x388` is the turret; for any other
//!   it is the body;
//! - any other source is offered to BuildingClass::SetTarget (vt+0x3C8,
//!   `0x00443B90`), which takes it only in range.
//!
//! Evidence: `tools/spatial_oracle/building_retaliation.json` runs the block
//! natively, with Set_Desired, Is_Rotating, SetTarget, GetWeapon and the RNG;
//! the tests replay its rows through [`Simulation::building_hit_response`]
//! and one sourced hit through the production receiver.
//!
//! RESIDUALS:
//! - A V3, Dreadnought or Boomer missile's hit names its launcher as the
//!   source; native names the rocket, an AircraftClass
//!   (`RocketLocomotionClass` `0x006632B8..0x006632C7`). Trigger: such a
//!   missile hits an armed AI building. Effect: native turns `+0x388` and
//!   draws once; VERA offers the launcher to SetTarget and draws nothing.
//!   Frequency: common in AI games. Later owner: the missile-source chain,
//!   which also owns kill credit, ShouldRetaliate and experience.
//! - `NotifyUnderAttack` springs TEvent 6 ("attacked by any house") on the
//!   house's tags (`0x004F95D4..0x004F95FD`, `0x006E53A0`); VERA's trigger
//!   runtime evaluates no such event. Trigger: maps with house-attached
//!   attack triggers. Effect: the trigger does not fire. Later owner: the
//!   trigger subsystem.
//! - The killing blow of a Selling or `Explodes=` building, which keeps
//!   IsAlive and runs the block natively: the residual at the call in
//!   `combat::world_receiver::commit_entities`.
//! - A heal with a source and a non-zero result runs the block natively; the
//!   receiver's healing arm returns before it. Trigger, reachability not
//!   traced: a repair IFV's RepairBullet (`[Mechanical]`, `Damage=-50`, 100%
//!   against `medium`) healing a deployed Slave Miner (YAREFN,
//!   `Armor=medium`), if its targeting admits the building. Effect: native
//!   pings the ore-miner line and stops at the ally test; VERA pings nothing.
//! - Is_Operational ([`Simulation::building_operational_state`]) counts no
//!   Tesla chargers and no EMP. Trigger: a Tesla Coil in a low-power base
//!   charged by two or more Tesla Troopers (`ElectricAssault=`), which native
//!   counts operational (`+0x67C >= 2`). Effect: native turns a human's coil
//!   with one draw and gives an AI's coil the source through SetTarget; VERA
//!   draws nothing, so the Scenario stream diverges, and SetTarget refuses.
//!   Frequency: uncommon, Soviet bases short of power. Later owner: the Tesla
//!   overpower chain, which ports the charger vector. No reachable retail EMP
//!   source was traced.
//!
//! No RNG beyond the one Scenario draw per turn; `+0x388`'s timer is the only
//! timer written; nothing is detached.
