//! Retail in-scenario modal state and transitions for the in-game menu and
//! abort-mission confirmation. Physical dialog presentation lives in the app
//! shell compositor and `ui::shell` resource geometry.
//!
//! ## What gamemd does
//!
//! A scenario carries one in-scenario state variable. Zero means "no modal, the
//! world runs"; every other value names a modal the scenario state machine
//! dispatches to. The states reachable in a stock offline skirmish are:
//!
//! | state | dialog | how it is entered | where it goes |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | 0 | none | every other state falls back here | the mission runs |
//! | 1 | the in-game menu | the sidebar menu control | its buttons |
//! | 3 | abort-mission confirm | the menu's Abort Mission button | see below |
//! | 5 | Game Controls / Options | the menu's Options button | back to 1 |
//!
//! Two re-entry rules matter to the player and are reproduced here:
//!
//! * **Options is a child of the menu.** When the Options dialog returns, the
//!   state machine re-enters state 1 — closing Options puts you back on the
//!   menu, it does not resume the mission.
//! * **Cancelling the abort confirmation resumes the mission**, it does not
//!   return to the menu: the confirm dialog's cancel result matches no case in
//!   the state machine's switch, so it falls through to state 0.
//!
//! The in-game menu's own dialog template is selected by game mode; offline
//! campaign and skirmish share one template whose controls are Load Game, Save
//! Game, Delete Game, Game Controls, Abort Mission and Resume Mission. B5 at
//! BEF9D0 contains exactly these six buttons and two statics; no mission-restate
//! control. Its three saved-game children share the native558DD0 browser owner.
//!
//! The full-screen B6 abort shell has a secondary action that is mode
//! dependent: campaign labels it `GUI:Restart` (restart the scenario),
//! multiplayer with two or more live human players labels it `GUI:Observe`, and
//! **offline skirmish hides it outright**. What is left in skirmish is one
//! action button captioned `GUI:Leave` and Resume Mission. Callback4F18B0
//! accepts Resume686 and IDOK1; IDCANCEL2 is ignored, so Escape stays in B6.
//! Confirming Leave queues an
//! EXIT event for the local player; when that event executes it raises the
//! graceful-exit session flag, which tears the session down *without* the
//! victory or defeat teardown — no result screen, no outcome announcement.
//!
//! Evidence: live decompilation of gamemd.exe this session — the scenario state
//! machine, the in-game menu modal and its dialog proc, the abort-confirm modal
//! and its dialog proc, the exit-event helper, `EventClass::Execute`'s EXIT
//! case, and the session-end router.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of ui/ — no dependencies on render/, assets/, sim/, audio/.
//! - The state enum is pure data with pure transitions; the app layer owns the
//!   side effects (freezing the sim, tearing the match down).
