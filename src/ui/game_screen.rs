//! Game screen state machine — which UI screen is active.
//!
//! The App checks this each frame to decide what to render (menu vs game).
//! Transitions are triggered by UI actions (e.g., clicking "Quick Play")
//! or loading completion.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of ui/ — no dependencies on render/, assets/, sim/, etc.
//! - Pure data enum. App.rs reads and mutates this.

/// Transitions:
/// - MainMenu → Loading (user clicks "Start Game")
/// - Loading → InGame (the loaded scenario starts)
/// - Loading → MissionResult (the load fails or its startup is rejected)
/// - InGame → MainMenu (user presses Escape)
